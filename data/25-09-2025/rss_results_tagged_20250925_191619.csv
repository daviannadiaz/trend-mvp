Nike Presents the Shox Z,"SummaryTeased during the summer, Nike has officially presented the Shox ZThe new model balances elegance and sportstyle with a versatility-oriented buildIt has already dropped in China and will be arriving globally later this yearNike has put the Shox franchise back in the spotlight this year, with several of its silhouettes offering an abundance of colorways throughout. While it's been asserted as a staple, there's only been a small handful of tangible moments in which the Shox has captivated the sneaker space. However, we hypothesized back in July that a newly-teased Shox model could bring fresh energy.Now, the Shox Z has officially been announced by Nike, coinciding with a limited launch in China. This elevated, minimalist take on the Shox franchise features a kitten heel-like build, balancing elegance and sportstyle. It's built for around-the-clock wear, offering a modern reinterpretation of the classic line. 10 colorways have been presented, ranging from a Martine Rose Shox MR4-adjacent black and red to neon iterations.For those looking to pick up a pair, Nike has officially launched the Shox Z in China. It is scheduled to see a global launch later this year via Nike SNKRS and select retailers in a wide variety of colorways at an expected price point of $140 USD. Stay tuned for updates as we await more information regarding its wider rollout.

"GoPro Announces New Product Trio, Including a True 8K 'MAX2' 360º Camera with Swappable Lenses","GoPro has announced a trio of new products including a hugely updated 360-degree camera, lifestyle-focused mini action camera, and an AI-powered gimbal that's not just compatible with GoPros (unlike its previous GoPro-only gimbal from 2016).And, interestingly, what GoPro isn't releasing this year might be just as notable: for the first time in over a decade, the brand will not be launching an updated flagship action camera this year, opting instead to focus on its new range and double down on last year's HERO13 Black.The all-new GoPro MAX2 leads the new bunch for the California-based brand, arriving as the successor to its original GoPro MAX from 2019. However, it's a successor in name only, because unlike its predecessor – which GoPro marketed as a 3-in-1 multi-use model – the MAX2 is a fully dedicated 360-degree camera with specs that challenge the very best from other brands in its category.Described by the brand as ""the world’s best, most durable 360 camera"", the MAX2 features dual lenses and can capture ""True 8K"" video – which, according to GoPro, makes the MAX2 is the only consumer-grade 360 camera to deliver the full 8K resolution in terms of usable pixels. This, it says, is unlike its main competitors in the category – the Insta360 X5 and DJI Osmo 360 – that are marketed as 8K cameras, but include non-usable pixels (such as those lost during the overlapping – or, ""stitching"" – process to create a 360-degree shot) to arrive at 8K. In further comparison to the X5 and Osmo 360, GoPro claims its MAX2 delivers 16% and 23% better resolution than each of its competitor's cameras, respectively.As well as its high-resolution, the MAX2 also features 10-Bit Color processing, GP Log encoding and six on-board microphones that capture audio in 360, affording both professionals and advanced hobbyists more control over the final look and sound of their footage. The camera's dual lenses are also fully replaceable and can be swapped out with a simple ""Twist-and-Go"" action, meaning should an accident happen (which is probably likely, given GoPro's extreme sports audience) the camera isn't rendered completely useless.Other features found in the MAX2 include the ability to capture 360-degree still photos in 29-megapixels, with the ultra high resolution allowing users to crop and zoom into their imagery freely. AI powers the new camera, too, with modes like ""AI Object Tracking"" and ""MotionFrame"" providing users with multiple options when it comes to content capture. The MAX2 is powered by a 1,960mAh battery optimized for extreme weather, making it usable in a wide range of conditions and temperatures. It also includes built-in GPS, a feature GoPro claims isn't available on another other 360 camera.Alongside the MAX2, GoPro is launching a new, miniature action camera that it's targeting towards the lifestyle crowd. The new GoPro LIT HERO is a small 4k camera with a built-in light – a ""Whatever, Whenever"" solution to your action camera needs, according to the brand. It can record 4k video at up to 60 frames per second, as well as ""2x slo-mo"". Like almost all GoPro cameras, the LIT HERO is waterproof and can be submerged up to 16-feet (5-meters). It weighs just 93-grams (3.28-ounces) and can record up to 100 minutes of video at the highest setting per full charge.GoPro is also – finally – releasing a new gimbal: the new GoPro Fluid Pro AI, a follow up to its GoPro Karma Grip from 2016. However, unlike the Karma Grip that only worked with GoPro cameras, the new Fluid Pro AI is compatible with everything from smartphones to point-and-shoot cameras weighing up to 400-grams (0.88-pounds), meaning creators on-the-go need not carry multiple devices. The 3-axis gimbal features interchangeable mounts, an intergrated fill light, and 18 hours of runtime per charge – power that can be used to charge your devices, since the Fluid Pro AI has a reverse-charging capability.The GoPro MAX2 and the GoPro LIT HERO cameras are both available to pre-order now via GoPro's website: the MAX2 is priced at £449.99 GBP / $499.99 USD and ships September 30, while the LIT HERO costs £239.99 GBP /$269.99 USD and ships starting October 21. The GoPro Fluid Pro AI gimbal will be available is dropping directly on October 21 and will be priced at $229.99 USD.

2026 Toyota GR Corolla: Evolution Comes in All Shapes and Sizes,"Toyota wants to make sure its improvements and upgrades are not only known but felt. Enter the 2026 GR Corolla, which has had incremental updates since its introduction in 2023. And after three years of refinement, the 4WD hot hatch is seriously impressive.⁠⁠Toyota invited us up to Napa Valley, California to test drive not only the 2026 GR Corolla, but also the 2026 GR Supra MKV Final Edition and the 2026 GR 86 Yuzu Edition. Key developers and engineers were there as well to walk us through all of the evolutionary upgrades and improvements throughout the generations. For the 2026 model year, the GR Corolla saw minor updates mainly in its body-in-white – the structural chassis on which the GR Corolla is built. Chief Engineer Naoyuki Sakamoto walked us through that key improvement: 45.6"" additional feet of adhesive bond. What may seem trivial to most in fact means the foundation of the GR Corolla is that much stiffer than not only the base model from a few years back, but also the hardcore GR Corolla Morizo Edition which had 10+"" feet more than the base on its own. The '26 GR Corolla also benefits from an additional air cooling duct at the front, feeding the engine more cool air for longer stints of track driving – this in fact was a direct response to Nürburgring testing and the need for it to withstand its 16.1 miles of track driving.Alongside the 2026 improvements, remember that 2024-2025 also saw evolutionary upgrades to the GR Corolla – stronger bolts that had larger heads and revised flanges are the small changes, while revised ABS, stiffer progressive springs, optimized air flow vents and even aluminum sheets to combat static electricity in the wheel well was all in the name of making the car feel more connected and purposeful on the track. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Hypedrive (@hypedrive)And with us testing the GR Corolla on Sonoma Raceway for the whole day, we can definitely confirm just how improved the 2026 MY GR Corolla really was, compared to both the 2023 and 2024 editions. The hot-hatch felt that much more nimbler, sharper, more direct and intact, while turn in at high speeds felt more controlled and flat. The GRC received more torque in 2025 – 295 lb-ft compared to the original Core's 273 – and that was obviously the first thing we felt, but we'd say it worked in unison with the incremental changes the developers applied throughout the years. If there was ever a chance to purchase a GR Corolla, 2026 is definitely the year to go for.During our track day, we also got behind the wheel of the GR Supra Final Edition, which is the brand's send off for the highly-popular GR Supra. We naturally gravitated towards the GT4 Style Pack edition, which saw aerodynamic upgrades as well as visual differences. We were quite indifferent to our white matte exterior paint model, but the aerodynamic trim pieces added to the front bumper arches and window edges – for wind buffeting – are proven upgrades especially for speeds above 100+ mph. The ""GR"" side vinyl may seem tacky to some, but we found it to be just the right amount of pizzazz to make the Final Edition stand out. Last but not least, we rounded out the GR testing with the GR 86 Yuzu Edition, which reminded us that we don't really need 400+ or even 300 horsepower; the GR 86's lighter body, balanced 50/50 weight distribution, mechanical limited slip differential and slick shifting manual gearbox plays so well with its ""low"" 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. It's true – power isn't everything.We're excited to see not only the GR Corolla being continually improved upon, but Toyota GR as a whole supporting its vehicles and constantly giving them attention. Some may see the technical improvements as minor but it's true that the little things really do add up.

Jordan Clarkson Brings His Signature Edge to ALDO,"If there’s a tunnel walk, New York Knicks' Jordan Clarkson is making it his runway. The NBA star’s athleticism and accomplishments on the court are certainly worthy of praise, but so is his one-of-a-kind style. And luckily, ALDO has taken note. The classic footwear brand tapped Clarkson to curate a selection of footwear and accessories emblematic of the athlete’s penchant for fearless fashion exploration, inviting others to unleash their creativity through daring, unfiltered self-expression.With the rise of cowboy core and the comeback appeal of timeless fashion staples, such as the city-certified loafer, the ALDO collection curated by Jordan Clarkson channels contemporary trends without compromising on craftsmanship. Maintaining urban sensibilities that translate from the office to the streets, its footwear options forgo conventionality in place of statement-making silhouettes — a nod to Clarkson’s bold, enigmatic energy. And what’s more daring than a man in a heel — a Cuban heel, to be exact? In conversation with Hypebeast, Clarkson opens up about his partnership with ALDO and what it means for the brand to spotlight him as a trendsetting aesthete. ""There’s a lot of noise in the footwear world, a lot of trend chasing. But what I love about ALDO is their look has always been steady and tasteful, giving people who care about fashion what they need to look good, and letting them bring the products to life with their own personal style,"" mentions Clarkson. ""This partnership means a lot to me because they trusted me to see the brand through my vision, and it just so happened that we have a lot in common. Our style is multifaceted - sometimes it’s understated, other times intentional, other times it’s turning heads.""Drafted in 2016 by the Washington Wizards and currently signed to the New York Knicks, Clarkson has made a household name for himself in a league defined by perseverance and excellent showmanship. Asked what memorable moments have defined his game, he mentions: ""When you’re playing all the time, it can be hard to pinpoint one exact moment because the season moves so fast. But when I do get a chance to slow down and reflect, what stands out most are the moments that showed how much I’ve grown - both in my game and as a person.""Off the court, the 2021 NBA 6th Man of The Year baller is nothing less than a showstopper. Known for his signature braids, black nail polish and refined, head-to-toe designer threads, Clarkson epitomizes modern tastes. There are no rules, just self-expression, and the more authentic, the better. In partnership with ALDO, the athlete’s edgy persona invites new interpretations of how to style the brand’s signature footwear. With Clarkson as the muse, the collaboration champions a new fashion vanguard and a cohort of young creatives and professionals who value fashion as a celebration of identity.And for Clarkson, the magic is in the details. ""Each outfit needs a different finishing touch to feel complete,"" says the athlete. ""Whether that’s a bag, a statement jacket, a sock, or a chain - I always look for one item that’s going to draw eyes and spark a conversation or make me feel more put together.""Highlights of the curation include “Guthrie,” a western-inspired boot with textured cowhide skin and a chunky block heel, available in ""Pony"" and ""Black"" colorways. The all-black version of “Guthrie” illuminates the shoe’s intricate embroidery at the back shaft while ""Pony""'s unique tonal pattern offers visual flair. The 1950s-style, rockabilly-inspired “Buckley” loafers feature contrast topstitching and a classic two-tone leather rendering emphasized by a contrast white overlay at the tongue. ""Zollo"" is a slip-on loafer style in a black monochromatic makeup, adorned with spiky, silver-toned hardware along the tongue and topline. ""Rocco"" delivers a chunky lace-up silhouette with an embroidered pattern engulfing the toecap. Appealing to a professional set, the all-black leather ""Bruguu"" and suede ""Hildebradd"" briefcases round out the curation, amplifying the brand’s business-to-play versatility.""Guthrie"" is a go-to of Clarkson's, currently in rotation during the globetrotter's travels. ""The cow print boot is my personal favorite - I’m sporting this pair in Texas, New York City, even in Paris. It’s a staple,"" says Clarkson.  Other footwear options, such as the ""Doublezero"" boots in khaki and black suede color options, prioritize daily utility and seasonal flexibility, reiterating the collection's seamless transition throughout the year. ""My style is very versatile. I get inspired by new trends and new designers all the time, and so I look for footwear that can either keep a look grounded, or bring something extra to elevate it,"" adds Clarkson. ""This collection does both. The styles are clean - a loafer or cowboy boot that you’ll want to wear over and over again - but designed with just the right amount of ‘different.’""In the accompanying campaign lookbook, Clarkson pairs the “Rocco” loafers with a suave shirt-and-vest duo and wide-leg denim. In another chic, all-indigo denim ensemble, the “Guthrie” boots in the ""Pony"" colorway add a pop of visual dimension. ""I just truly enjoy expressing myself through fashion,"" says Clarkson. ""Everyone has their own vibe, their own individuality when it comes to style, and that’s what makes it fun to watch.""See the ALDO collection curated by Jordan Clarkson in the galleries above.

Leon Xu Paints the Instability of Memory in “Afterglow”,"SummaryMarking the second solo exhibition of Chinese-born, New York-based painterThe show takes inspiration from Martin Scorsese’s 'After Hours' filmMai 36 Galerie in Zurich presents Afterglow, the second solo exhibition of Chinese-born, New York-based painter Leon Xu, on view through November 1, 2025. The show takes inspiration from Martin Scorsese’s After Hours, drawing on its atmosphere of chaos, shifting control and the uneasy pull of the night.Xu interprets the film’s mood rather than its storyline, using airbrush and acrylic to create paintings that blur edges and dissolve into dreamlike impressions. Works such as “Skyline,” “Neon Letters” and “Veils of Light” appear like half-remembered moments, suspended between clarity and disappearance. The canvases capture the glow of fleeting encounters, the intensity of disorientation and the fragile calm that follows.In Afterglow, Xu resists fixed narrative and invites viewers to linger in uncertainty. His paintings highlight how memory slips, how perception sharpens and blurs and how beauty often becomes visible only when it begins to fade.Maie 36 GalerieRämistrasse 378001 ZürichSwitzerland Click here to view full gallery at Hypebeast",https://hypebeast.com/2025/9/leon-xu-afterglow-mai-36-galerie-zurch-exhibition,new,2025-09-25T19:16:15.471036+00:00,https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2025%2F09%2F24%2Fleon-xu-afterglow-mai-36-galerie-zurch-exhibition-0.jpg?w=800&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max,['cross_industry']

LEGO® Transforms the Champs-Élysées for a Day of Play,"In a follow-up to its PLAY Pavilion activation at London’s Serpentine Gallery, The LEGO Group brought its “Never Stop Playing” initiative to Paris with Le Grand Tournoi des Champs.Set along the Champs-Élysées, the building tournament put creativity on the calendars of thousands across the region, including stars Pharrell Williams, Jourdan Dunn, and Nella Rose, who attended with their loved ones. Joining the brick-fandom masses, Hypebeast headed to the iconic landmark to get a closer look at what went down at the jam-packed day of play. Early on a Sunday morning, the central Paris boulevard was prepared with over 250 tables and giant LEGO® minifigure marking the stage. As participants began to arrive, some stopped to take a look at the colorful dioramas and giant structures, while others were quick to claim their table in eagerness to showcase their building skills. Emerging from a cloud of red and yellow confetti, hosts Faustine Bollaert and Jean-Philippe Doux kicked off the tournament and carefully laid out the different challenges for the three rounds. After unboxing the LEGO® bricks, guests got into game mode, competing for the tallest tower and most creative team mascot. When asked about her strategy for brick building, Dunn shared, “I use instructions as a guideline, but if there is a better way to do it, then I’ll do it that way. It’s all trial and error.”For the finale, each team channeled their imagination to recreate a famous Parisian landmark of their choice. Among all the wildest and vibrant builds, it was a showstopping redesign of the Arc de Triomphe that awarded The Dream Builders the winning trophy. Although the team members had only met mere hours before, their shared passion for LEGO® proved that creativity and play are a uniting force, whatever age.

Roger Dubuis Broadens Its Excalibur Knights of the Round Table Watch Series With “The Enchanter Merlin”,"SummaryRoger Dubuis' ""The Enchanter Merlin"" limited edition spotlights a white-and-gold dial starring 12 pink-gold knights as hour markersIt features 56 hex columns spanning enamel, Murano glass, pink and rhodium-plated gold, complete with invisible-set diamonds and ruthenium crystalsRoger Dubuis continues its Arthurian saga with the Excalibur Knights of the Round Table: The Enchanter Merlin -- the second chapter in “The Tale of Merlin” following 2024’s Omniscient Merlin. This edition shifts from basalt-inspired darkness to a radiant white-and-gold palette, paying tribute to Merlin’s invisible Crystal Palace built for the Lady of the Lake. The watch transforms its dial into a micro-sculptural realm, where shimmering columns rise like palace walls above a rippling lake of metal crystals.Each dial begins with an 18k pink-gold base plate machined with hexagonal apertures that house 56 columns in varying materials and heights: nine in Murano-style glass, 19 in polished white enamel, 10 in matte white enamel, nine in polished pink gold and nine in rhodium-plated gold — all crowned with invisibly set hexagonal diamonds. These columns, ranging from 0.2 mm to 3.7 mm tall, create a multidimensional landscape, while a layer of sparkling ruthenium crystals at the dial’s base evokes sunlight dancing on a still lake, underscoring the palace’s ethereal illusion.Encircling this crystalline tableau stand the twelve Knights of the Round Table, each a six-millimeter-tall figure cast in 18k pink gold. Beginning as hand-sculpted resin prototypes, the knights are 3D-scanned, molded and cast before master engravers spend two to three days bestowing every sword, helmet and armor plate with lifelike detail and a subtle black patina. Set against a Murano-glass flange bearing golden indices, these vigilant sentinels double as hour markers, embodying the watch’s themes of protection and chivalry.Housed in a 45 mm 18k pink-gold Excalibur case, the Enchanter Merlin is driven by the in-house Monobalancier RD821 automatic movement, comprising 172 components and adorned with 14 types of hand finishes to earn the Poinçon de Genève. A sword-guard crown protector, sapphire window beneath the bezel and 360-degree pink-gold micro-rotor echo medieval architecture, while a quick-release white leather strap completes the ensemble.Limited to just 28 pieces, the Excalibur Knights of the Round Table: The Enchanter Merlin is priced at 336,000 CHF (approx. $422,179 USD) and available only via Roger Dubuis boutiques.

U.S. economy grew more than expected in the second quarter at a 3.8% pace,"An uptick in consumer spending helped the U.S. economy expand at a surprising 3.8% from April through June, the government reported in a dramatic upgrade of its  previous estimate  of second-quarter growth. 
 U.S. gross domestic product — the nation’s output of goods and services — rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by  fallout from President Donald Trump ’s  trade wars , the Commerce Department said Thursday. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure. 
 The  first-quarter GDP drop , the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports — which are subtracted from GDP — as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points. 
 Consumer spending  rose at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government’s previous estimate of 1.2%. 
 “The U.S. consumer remained a lot stronger than many thought, even in the midst of a stock market sell-off and a lot of trade uncertainty,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, posted on social media. 
 A category within the GDP data that measures the economy’s underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government’s previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. 
 But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth. 
 Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter. 
 Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% — “not great but much better than initially thought.” 
 Since returning to the White House, Trump has overturned decades of U.S. policy in support of freer trade. He’s slapped  double-digit taxes — tariffs — on imports  from almost every country on earth and targeted specific products for tariffs, too, including steel, aluminum and autos. 
 Trump sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the United States and to help pay for the  massive tax cuts  he signed into law July 4. 
 But mainstream economists — whose views Trump and his advisers reject — say that his tariffs will damage the economy, raising costs and making protected U.S. companies less efficient. They note that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. Therefore, tariffs can be inflationary — though their impact on prices so far has been modest. 
 The unpredictable way that Trump has imposed the tariffs — announcing and suspending them, then coming up with new ones — has left businesses bewildered, contributing to a sharp deceleration in  hiring . 
 From 2021 through 2023, the United States added an impressive 400,000 jobs a month as the economy bounded back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Since then, hiring has stalled, partly because of trade policy uncertainty and partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve’s inflation fighters in 2022 and 2023. 
 Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more — to an average 53,000 a month. 
 On Oct. 3, the Labor Department is expected to report that employers added just 43,000 jobs in September, though unemployment likely stayed at a low 4.3%, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet. 
 Seeking to bolster the job market, the Fed last week  cut its benchmark interest rate  for the first time since December and signaled that it expected two more cuts this year. But the surprisingly strong second-quarter GDP growth may give the central bank less reason to cut rates — despite intense pressure from Trump to do so. Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge — the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — comes out Friday. 
 Thursday’s GDP report was Commerce Department’s third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30. 
 Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect the GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.

Home sales drop in August despite mortgage rate slide,"Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes remained sluggish in August, even as a late-summer slide in mortgage rates brought home loan borrowing costs to a 10-month low. 
 Existing home sales slipped 0.2% last month from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That’s the slowest sales pace since June. 
 Sales rose 1.8% compared with August last year. The latest sales figure topped the 3.96 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet. 
 The national median sales price increased 2% in August from a year earlier to $422,600. That’s the 26th consecutive month that home prices have risen on an annual basis and the highest median sales price for any August on data going back to 1999. 
 The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows.  Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year  to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Through the first eight months of this year, home sales are down 1.2% compared to the same period last year. 
 Mortgage rates have been mostly declining  since late July ahead of the Federal Reserve’s widely anticipated  decision last week  to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market. 
 But while lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, borrowing costs remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home following years of skyrocketing home prices. Consider, the U.S. median home sales price is now 52% higher than it was in August 2019, before the housing market superheated during the initial years of the pandemic. 
 “However, mortgage rates are declining and more inventory is coming to the market, which should boost sales in the coming months,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. 
 Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in June and July, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.85% to 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. The decline in mortgage rates accelerated in August and this month, dropping the average rate as low as 6.26% last week. 
 Homebuilders have had success drumming up sales by lowering prices and offering incentives, including paying to lower mortgage rates for home shoppers who may not be able to afford to buy at current rates. 
 Sales of new single-family U.S. homes jumped 20.5% in August from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 800,000 units, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday. Sales were up 15.4% from a year earlier, the strongest pace so far this year, but are still running about 1.4% lower than a year ago. 
 However, new home sales are a small fraction of the overall housing market, which remains constrained by lack of affordability and a chronic shortage of homes for sale, especially those in the more affordable end of the market. 
 That trend has weighed especially on first-time homebuyers, who don’t have home equity gains to put toward a new home purchase. They accounted for 28% of homes sales last month. Historically, they made up 40% of home sales. 
 Still, the inventory of homes for sale across the U.S. has increased gradually as the market has slowed and is now at a level where supply and demand are more balanced. 
 There were 1.53 million unsold homes at the end of last month, down 1.3% from July and up 11.7% from August last year, NAR said. That’s still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic. 
 August’s month-end inventory translates to a 4.6-month supply at the current sales pace, matching the supply level at the end of July and an increase from 4.2 months in August last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers. 
 Homes are also taking longer to sell. Properties typically remained on the market for 31 days last month before selling, up from 26 days a year earlier, NAR said. 
 The longer homes linger on the market, the more pressure it puts on homeowners eager to sell to give buyers a better deal. That’s led to more sellers lowering prices. 
 A little over 20% of homes on the market in August had their initial listing price lowered, according to Realtor.com. 
 If mortgage rates continue to ease, that should help bring out more buyers, but economists’ forecasts generally call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year. 
 “Despite improvement, rates are still not low enough to unlock the vast majority of homeowners, who continue to enjoy sub 6% rates, but it will help those on the margins and may lead to a more active fall home sales season,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.

"Former Fed chairs Greenspan, Bernanke, and Yellen back Lisa Cook in Supreme Court case","Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen  and other former top economic officials appointed by presidents of both parties urged the  Supreme Court  on Thursday to preserve the Federal Reserve’s political independence and allow  Lisa Cook  to remain as a central bank governor for now. 
 The justices are weighing an  emergency appeal  from the administration to remove Cook while her lawsuit challenging her firing by Republican President  Donald Trump proceeds through the courts . 
 The White House campaign to unseat Cook marks an unprecedented bid to reshape the Fed board, which was designed to be largely independent from day-to-day politics. No president has fired a sitting Fed governor in the agency’s 112-year history. 
 Earlier in September, a judge determined that Trump’s move to fire Cook probably was illegal. An appeals court rejected an emergency plea to oust Cook before the Fed’s meeting last week when Cook joined in a vote to cut a key interest rate by one-quarter of a percentage point. 
 A day after that meeting, the administration turned to the Supreme Court and again asked for her prompt removal. 
 In their filing, lawyers for the former economic officials wrote that immediately ousting Cook “would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed’s independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.” 
 Greenspan, Bernanke, and Yellen served as successive chairs of the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, spanning six presidential administrations back to 1987. Greenspan and Bernanke were initially appointed by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, respectively. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Yellen to the Fed and she was Democratic President Joe Biden’s treasury secretary. 
 The list of signatories includes other treasury secretaries, heads of the Council of Economic Advisers and former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a former chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
 Trump  sought to fire Cook  on Aug. 25, but a judge ruled that she could  remain in her job . Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and a smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. 
 Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents  obtained by The Associated Press , Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. In a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a “2nd home.” Both documents appear to undercut the administration’s claims of fraud. 
 The attempt to fire Cook differs from Trump’s dismissal of board members of other independent agencies. Those firings, including at the National Labor Relations Board, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission, have been done at will. 
 In allowing those firings to proceed for now, the Supreme Court cautioned that it viewed the Fed differently. Trump has invoked the provision of the law that set up the Federal Reserve and allowed for governors to be dismissed “for cause.”

Meta’s massive Louisiana data center needs a $3 billion power upgrade. Who should foot the bill?,"In a rural corner of Louisiana,  Meta is building  one of the world’s largest data centers, a  $10 billion behemoth  as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer. 
 While the  colossal project  is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility. 
 Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the  AI -driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight. 
 Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs. 
 Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals. 
 “You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said. 
 Private deals for public power supply 
 Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates. 
 Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay. 
 Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details. 
 Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data. 
 Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs. 
 “There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said. 
 Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue. 
 Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group. 
 Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers. 
 But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility. 
 Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.” 
 How is this tackled in other states? 
 Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers. 
 Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers. 
 And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies. 
 Locals have mixed feelings 
 Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish. 
 “We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived. 
 In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600. 
 But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says. 
 “We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

"Bill Clinton calls out aid cuts, political unrest, and more at the Clinton Global Initiative","Former President Bill Clinton opened the  annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative  Wednesday with a list of things that worry him. 
 “It would be irresponsible, almost jarring, for us to take off and not acknowledge the traumatic rise in  political violence  that we’ve seen in our country,” Clinton said about the shooting deaths of conservative activist  Charlie Kirk  and former Minnesota House Speaker  Melissa Hortman  and her husband, Mark. “We’re pulling further and further away from one another.” 
 Clinton said he worried about the  dismantling of domestic and foreign assistance  programs, “the war on science and public health,” cuts to education, trade wars, and being “at risk of losing our freedom of speech.” 
 “We’re trying to do everything we can to provide a counterweight to a lot of the negative things that have taken place in the last several months,” Clinton said of the two-day conference, which shifted its format to create working groups to tackle many of the issues he outlined. 
 The conference’s biggest announcement on Wednesday was a partnership between the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI that will provide Gilead Sciences’ HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries for $40 a person each year, starting in 2027. The Gates Foundation announced a similar agreement with the Indian manufacturer Hetero Labs. 
 Clinton said the move was partially in response to  foreign aid cuts  from  President Donald Trump’s administration , which he said could lead to more than 6 million more HIV cases and potentially 4 million more deaths in Africa. In July, GOP leaders  stopped an additional cut  of $400 million to PEPFAR, a program combating HIV/AIDS credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush. 
 Points of Light Chairman Neil Bush said PEPFAR and the way it has helped so many in Africa has always been a point of family pride. And though he hasn’t talked to his brother, former President George W. Bush, about the new program announced at the Clinton Global Initiative, Neil Bush said he sees it as a way philanthropy can help fill in gaps. 
 “It seems like America’s withdrawal from the world is having terrible ramifications, in my personal view,” he said, adding that Points of Light hopes to increase the help it provides through its ambitious plan to  double the number of volunteers  in America in the next 10 years. 
 Activist and philanthropist Abigail Disney urged Clinton Global Initiative attendees to be more aggressive in their giving and encouraged them to support cultural movements instead of programs. 
 “I don’t care where you are on the political spectrum — there is mistrust, there’s fear and there is anger, and we should all be very alarmed,” Disney said. “And I hang around big philanthropies these days and I don’t see any alarm. I don’t think that’s because they’re not alarmed. I think that’s because they’re afraid. Everybody’s afraid.” 
 However, President Clinton said that the Clinton Global Initiative, which launched in 2005, has always looked to create solutions. 
 “If we hold our heads high, keep our eyes and ears open and deal with others with an outstretched hand and not a clenched fist, we’ve got a chance to keep hope alive,” he said. “We have the chance to make a meaningful difference in other people’s lives.”

Neuroscience: Go swimming and your brain will thank you,"Memorial Day weekend marks the unofficial start of summer, which means many entrepreneurs’ minds are turning towards  beach getaways , lakeside camping trips, or lazy days at the pool  with the kids . 
 These kinds of water-based activities are a great way to  relax  and stay cool. But according to fascinating research in neuroscience, swimming isn’t just a  fun vacation  activity. It actually has special brain benefits that other forms of exercise just can’t match.  
 Not just another form of exercise  
 It will surprise exactly no one that  exercise is good for your brain . (If this is news to you, here are  some   studies  for you to  get up to speed .) Swimming is, obviously, a form of exercise, so therefore it’s good for your brain too. And that’s the end of it, right?  
 Not exactly. Swimming is a perfectly excellent way to get the generalized benefits of more movement in your life if that’s your preferred way to work out. But psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered a variety of unique benefits that swimming seems to provide.  
 1. Swimming reduces stress.  
 In fact, the benefits of swimming start before you even stick a toe in the water. Psychologists have discovered that even just  looking at a beach seems to help us calm down  and let go of stress.  
 “Recent  experiments  show that after just two minutes of viewing water outdoors, blood pressure and heart rate drop. It’s more  calming  to look at a lake, pool, or stream than trees or grass. And wider bodies of water bring more tranquility,” explained star psychologist Adam Grant in a recent edition of his newsletter,  Granted .  
 Evolutionary psychologists suggest this may be because marine environments offered our hunter gatherer ancestors a rich source of food and a clear view of incoming predators. Whatever the reason though, the effect is clear. The human brain seems wired to  love the beach .  
 2. Swimming makes your brain work better.   
 You might spend time by the pool or lake in order to forget the stresses of your working life. But while you’re leaving your stresses behind, you’re actually also boosting your memory in general.  
 For one study, neuroscientists forced  rats  to do daily laps in a mini rat pool and then tested their memories. “After just seven days of swim training, researchers saw improvements in both short- and long-term memories, based on a reduction in the errors rats made each day,”  reports neuroscientist Seena Mathew .  
 And it’s not just rats. Studies on whether humans see the same cognitive benefits are ongoing but initial results are promising. One showed kids  recalled a list of words much more accurately after swimming , compared to when they colored or did CrossFit-like exercise. Another study of older adults “concluded that swimmers had  improved mental speed and attention  compared with non-swimmers,”  Mathew says .  
 3. Swimming boosts mental health.  
 If your holiday involves swimming outdoors under the sky, you can expect to see additional benefits. A large recent global survey of “wild swimmers”—i.e., those who take their dips in open air pools or natural environments—found that mixing swimming and nature delivered a particularly large boost to people’s well-being.  
 Experiment after experiment shows  nature just seems to make humans happier . But the researchers behind the study think something else is driving much of the increase in mental health experienced by wild swimmers.  
 “Our study suggests that the key to this effect lies in experiencing feelings of autonomy and competence—freedom and mastery over the swimmer’s environment—two factors that are strongly linked to well-being,”  explained Lewis Elliot , one of the researchers behind the findings.  
 Swimming outdoors makes us feel free and  confident . And freedom and confidence make us happier.  
 Time to hit the beach or pool?  
 All of which adds up to a simple message for entrepreneurs: If you’re daydreaming of the beach, pool, or lake this Memorial Day weekend, maybe you should follow your impulse to plan that trip. You already know swimming is a great way to unwind. New neuroscience reveals it is also apparently a form of exercise with special brain benefits.

$100B OpenAI investment shows Nvidia’s enduring leverage in AI,"Welcome to   AI  Decoded,  Fast Company ’s weekly newsletter that breaks down the most important news in the world of AI. I’m Mark Sullivan, a senior writer at  Fast Company,   covering emerging tech, AI, and tech policy. 
 This week, I’m focusing on the terms of Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI, in which the GPU maker gets guaranteed chip sales, an equity stake, and likely a product road map for years to come. I also look at the industry’s fixation on huge models and the quiet appeal of small ones.

 Nvidia cements its power as AI infrastructure race begins 
 Now it’s all about data centers and electricity. Big Tech companies are promising that AI models and apps are about to revolutionize business, and executives like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman say the greatest barrier to that happening is a  dearth of data centers  to run the models that businesses will soon need to operate. Big Tech companies are also challenged to find enough new energy sources to power and cool the massive data centers. Collectively, OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft plan to spend more than $325 billion on data centers by the end of 2025,  The   New York Times   reports . Anthropic said last year that it expects to spend $100 billion on these massive facilities over the next decade.  
 The tech companies are now racing to plan and finance the new data centers. And this is creating some unique arrangements. Nvidia  announced  Monday it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI, which will buy about 2% equity in the company. But OpenAI will likely use most of that money to buy Nvidia GPUs, or graphics processing units, the chips that represent the greatest single capital expenditure of building a data center. “[T]hese investments might be circular and raise related party concerns, as Nvidia may own shares in a customer that will likely use such funds to buy more Nvidia gear,” writes Morningstar equity analyst Brian Colello in a research brief. (OpenAI struck a similar agreement with Microsoft when it took a  $10 billion investment  from the software giant, then used the money to buy its Azure cloud computing services.)  
 Notably, the Nvidia investment will time the release of the funds according to the pace at which OpenAI buys the chips: Nvidia gets guaranteed chip sales and a 2% share of OpenAI. (As Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management,  told  CNBC: “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia.”). But it may be even better than that. Pitchbook AI and cybersecurity analyst Dimitri Zabelin believes Nvidia intends to plan the design of its future AI chips according to what it learns from OpenAI’s infrastructure scale-up. That could be an invaluable feedback loop if all of the big AI companies follow OpenAI’s lead in scaling up its infrastructure and developing compute-intensive AI products. “Nvidia is consolidating control over the AI stack and reinforcing its position as the indispensable enabler of the sector’s next phase,” Zabelin says. 
 OpenAI will likely buy between 4 and 5 million of Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin GPUs, which will require 10 gigawatts of power to run. They will likely be installed within the  five new data centers  the company just announced as part of its  Stargate Project  (revealed at the White House with partners SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX). OpenAI now expects that Stargate will secure the full $500 billion in planned investment to build new data centers, and do so by the end of this year, ahead of schedule. 
 Betting big on big models—not smaller, safer ones 
 Right now, a huge portion of the total value of the stock market is held up by AI hope, the promise that AI will bring dramatic new efficiencies to the way business is done. Maybe businesses will grow more profitable by moving faster, or maybe they’ll do so by sloughing off human workers. Most likely both. The massive infrastructure investments of the Big Tech companies are all about supporting that transformation. The companies building the gigantic data centers are frontier model companies; their products are huge, generalist models, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google’s Gemini, that have trillions of parameters and are very expensive to train and operate. Generalist models are built to possess a wide array of knowledge—even a modicum of common sense about how the world works—that can be leveraged for all kinds of tasks. They’re trained with massive amounts of diverse data and web content. It’s these frontier models that the AI companies hope will evolve to possess artificial general intelligence (AGI), or as much intelligence as most humans bring to most tasks, and then superintelligence, in which the model is far smarter than humans at almost any task.  
 But many of the analysts and researchers I’ve spoken to say that businesses usually need smaller models trained with a narrower set of (often proprietary) data that automate a specific set of tasks. They don’t need to power their apps with a gigantic (and expensive) model that knows about 15th-century gold coins and can write poetry. Small models often don’t need to run inside a dedicated data center, but are small enough to run on on-premise computers (in some cases, laptops or phones) or within a private cloud. With less exposure to wider networks, models that run on the edge devices are far less exposed to would-be hackers that might try to steal or poison corporate or personal data.  
 But OpenAI and Google aren’t selling that. They offer access to frontier models via application programming interfaces (APIs) to developers and corporations. And it’s the massive frontier models that carry the greatest risks for society-level harms such as aiding in the building of a bioweapon or crashing economic systems. Some have worried that putting so much intelligence and computing power together in one place could create a supercomputer smart enough to crack open every cryptocurrency wallet on the blockchain—which would cause economic chaos. Reducing the number of large frontier models (and tightly controlling their use) may be the only rational approach to protecting against the large-scale harms they might, in theory, inflict. Currently, as the big AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta quickly and dramatically scale up their data centers and models, we are trusting them to keep the models from being used for harm. Can private, profit-driven companies—some of which are under great pressure to get to profitability—control intelligences far greater than our own? Let’s hope so.

EU reveals tariff deal with Trump will save its automakers up to $700 million a month,"European automakers will save around 500-600 million euros ($585-700 million) a month dating back to Aug. 1 after the Trump administration implemented the U.S. end of its  trade deal with the European Union , the EU’s top trade negotiator said Thursday. 
 Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that the deal establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods took effect with publication in the U.S. Federal Register instructing customs officials what to charge. That would reduce the tariff from a  painfully high 27.5% rate set earlier by Trump . 
 The reduction eases a major burden on EU automakers and is a chief selling point for the deal as presented by European Commission President  Ursula von der Leyen . 
 The deal is retroactive to Aug. 1 so “what we expect now is that the tariffs will be returned to the automakers as of the first of August, which is something like 500, 600 million euros per month,” Sefcovic said ahead of a meeting with Southeast Asian trade ministers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
 The 15% tariff is still much higher than tariffs from before Trump took office, which averaged in the single digits, and the trade deal has been criticized by business associations and some members of the European Parliament. 
 Sefcovic said most member states supported the deal and that after detailed exchanges and presentations on the details he expected lawmakers would support it as well. 
 He said it was “the best deal available” after difficult talks with Trump administration officials. “Any other alternative would be much worse,” he said. Trump threatened even higher rates during the talks.

The new dressing rooms of this major stadium belong in ‘Architectural Digest’,"The Barclays Center is taking its dressing rooms for touring artists to the next level, and they looked to local inspiration to decorate them. 
 The  Brooklyn venue , which hosts concerts and is  home to the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets  and WNBA’s New York Liberty, has upgraded six dressing rooms that now resemble Brooklyn brownstone apartments, complete with moody tones, soft-glow lighting, and high-end fixtures and finishes. 
 [Photo: Barclays Center/BSE] 
 The makeover is part of Barclays Center parent company BSE Global’s $100 million, five-year upgrade of the venue that’s still set to include improvements like a new fan zone and a new premium membership club. Laurie Jacoby, BSE Global’s chief entertainment officer, tells  Fast Company  the plan for the renovations is “to elevate the guest experience at every level, whether you’re a fan attending a concert or game, or an artist bringing your talent to our stage.” 
 It’s especially important for artists, she says.

 “For touring artists, a dressing room is often their only connection to the city they’re performing in,” Jacoby says. “That’s why we designed our dressing rooms to capture the essence of a Brooklyn brownstone, featuring paneled walls, herringbone floors, warm lighting, and elegant finishes that create a cozy, residential atmosphere—a true home away from home right inside the arena.” 
 [Photo: Barclays Center/BSE] 
 BSE Global designed the dressing rooms in partnership with  the Brooklyn Home Company , a real estate development and design firm that typically works on condos, townhomes, and vacation homes.

 The team designed each room to pay homage different Brooklyn neighborhoods around the stadium. Park Slope was inspired by diners and wine bars, Brooklyn Heights by red brick, Prospect by the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, and Boerum Hill by the oxidization of copper. There’s also a classic brownstone-inspired room for Clinton Hill, and a green room  with plants  to represent Fort Greene. Construction began following the end of the 2024–25 NBA season, and the dressing rooms can seat up to 56 people.

 BSE Global wants the new Barclays Center to do more than impress rock bands, rappers, DJs, and pop stars. The team also hopes the elevated space will lead to elevated performances.

 “Our hope is that these new spaces provide comfort and hospitality for artists spending long hours on the road,” Jacoby says. “We know that when performers feel at home and relaxed, they deliver their best performances—which is ultimately a benefit to both fans and the overall experience.” 
 Among the first artists who’ll use the new dressing rooms are Reneé Rapp, who’s bringing her Bite Me Tour to Brooklyn next month, and  Tame Impala , who’s playing four nights there.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410199/barclays-center-dressing-rooms-look-like-brooklyn-browns,"new, next",2025-09-25T19:16:15.744979+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-01-91410199-barclays-dressing-room.jpg",['cross_industry']
"‘Sponge cities’ architect, Yu Kongjian, dies in plane crash in Brazil","The crash of a small plane in southwestern Brazil killed four people including Chinese landscape architect and urban planner  Yu Kongjian , Brazilian authorities said Wednesday. The accident happened late Tuesday during a landing attempt at a large farm about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the municipality of Aquidauana in Mato Grosso do Sul state, firefighters said. Yu, who was known for promoting  ecologically sound development , was traveling with two Brazilian documentary makers, Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were making a film about the Pantanal wetlands. All three were killed along with pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, authorities said. Yu was know for developing the concept of  “sponge cities,”  with infrastructure that can absorb rainwater to mitigate flood risks and improve the urban climate. “In times of climate change,” Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wrote on social media, “Yu became a global reference with his sponge cities, which unite quality of life and environmental protection.” Yu argued that by creating large spaces to hold water in city centers, such as parks and ponds, extreme rainfall can be absorbed, helping prevent floods. The idea is widely cited in Chinese urban planning, and in recent years Yu worked on projects in other countries including Saudi Arabia and Thailand. He was known for his “notable contributions to sustainable urbanism, the preservation of biodiversity, and the protection of the planet,” Brazil’s Vice President Geraldo Alckmin said on X, adding that Yu’s legacy will continue to inspire those dedicated to ecological cause. Yu founded the College of Architecture and Landscape at Peking University, one of China’s most prestigious universities. The university did not respond a request for comment. The military fire department in Aquidauana was called at around 8:10 p.m. local time on Tuesday to respond to a plane crash, firefighters said. A search and rescue operation lasted approximately nine hours. Yu and the filmmakers were part of a team producing a documentary about the world’s largest tropical wetlands. The Pantanal, fed by tributaries of the Paraguay River and mostly located in Brazil, is a biodiversity hotspot and a popular destination for tourists to see jaguars, macaws, caimans, capybaras and migratory birds in the wild. In an interview with The Associated Press in 2022, Yu criticized much of Asia’s modern infrastructure for being built on ideas imported from Europe, which he said are ill-fitted to the monsoon climate that prevails over much of the continent.

5 ways to keep yourself from overspending on social media’s niche trends,"Did you buy a new pink dress to watch the Barbie movie, only to never wear it again? An Oura ring because your favorite  TikTok influencer  had it? A new pair of baggy jeans because ’90s fashion is making a comeback? Niche trends  fueled by social media can influence your shopping decisions. Participating often brings some happiness and a sense of community, but the problem comes when you do it so often that you’re not using your money to  achieve your financial goals , or worse, you get into debt, said Erika Rasure, chief financial wellness advisor for Beyond Finance, a financial services company. Whether it’s coastal grandma or clean girl aesthetic,  microtrends  can take a significant toll on already-strained budgets as prices rise and  Gen Z struggles  to pay off debt. If you find yourself overspending to participate in microtrends, here are some expert recommendations: 
 Pause before purchasing 
 Before you click “buy” on  TikTok Shop , it’s best if you take some time to reflect, said Jennifer Seitz, head of education for Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. Pausing before a purchase can help you discern if the item is something you really want or a fleeting craving. “Think if you want to put it in a schedule pause, whether it’s 24 hours or even a couple of days if it’s a larger expense,” Seitz said. Participating in personal challenges can be a good way to get in the habit of making purchases more deliberate. Back in 2022, Alyssa Barber participated in the no-buy year challenge, where she pledged to stop buying non-essential items for a year. Barber shares sustainable practices with over 370,000 followers on  TikTok , where one of her recurrent themes is how to stop impulse buying. Barber said the challenge gave her perspective on how much she was spending on things she didn’t need. Since then, she has changed her spending habits, focusing mainly on experiences. 
 Know your spending values 
 Taking a value-based spending approach can help you decide if you should participate in a trend you see online, Rasure said. If, for example, you want to build an emergency fund, having this goal in mind while shopping can help avoid unnecessary spending. Quynh Van, a 27-year-old UX designer from Minneapolis, was surprised by the number of ads on TikTok when she created an account after a four-year break from social media. And while being influenced by the ads is inevitable, she believes overspending comes in part from users not having defined goals. “When you don’t know who you are or what you like, you’re so driven by over-consumerism and lifestyle creep because you don’t have your values in order,” Van said. Rasure recommends using your financial values as a guiding principle for your spending decisions. If you’re not sure of your values, allocate some time to map them out according to your life goals. 
 Create barriers to spending 
 If a purchase is one click away, it can make it easier to spend large amounts of money. If you consciously make it a little harder to pay for an item, you can spend more mindfully, Seitz said. “Just that action of needing to input your payment information rather than just that simple click can help you give to really stop and think about purchases before moving ahead with them,” she added. To add barriers, you can remove your credit card details from your computer browser or social media and disable Apple Pay on your phone. 
 Think of it as an act of self-care 
 Finances are closely tied to emotions, and often, they evoke negative feelings such as shame or guilt. However, reframing them as an act of self-care can help you spend mindfully, Rasure said. “It can help you create boundaries around what you value spending money on, helps you choose intentionally and it feels more like freedom instead of restriction,” she said. Your spending habits in the present can help your future financial situation. This mindset can inspire you when you’re tempted to overspend on the newest trending electronic or fashion item. 
 Engage with trends with moderation 
 It can be OK to engage with trends if they bring you positive feelings, Rasure said. Van decided to participate in the matcha trend, but with moderation. For Barber, physical media, such as old records, DVDs, and cassettes, is on her list of non-negotiable expenses, as she loves collecting these items. “Trends and engaging them, engaging in them really should spark that happiness or contentment, not the debt that can go with them,” Rasure said.

Ned Fulmer’s podcast episode about his cheating scandal is being roasted online,"Remember when former Try Guy Ned Fulmer was caught in a public cheating scandal that broke the internet? He’s back, this time with a new podcast called  Rock Bottom with Ned Fulmer . Or as one commenter called it: “One of the most painful watches in YouTube history.” 
 The podcast is meant to explore, “people’s lowest, most embarrassing, and challenging moments.” Fulmer’s first guest: his wife, Ariel.  
 The first question many have asked is why would they do this? “Was this a humiliation ritual for him?” one  TikTok  user  asked . According to Ariel, it was mostly for their children, aged 7 and 5, who they are currently coparenting, and as a way to move on and put the past in the past by bringing it all up again.  
 In case you were living under a rock in 2022 and have no idea what a “Try Guy” is or what happened, let us catch you up to speed.  
 The Try Guys were four former BuzzFeed employees, Keith Habersberger, Ned Fulmer, Zach Kornfeld, and Eugene Lee Yang, who made content based around the simple premise of trying various things. In late 2022, their YouTube channel had close to 8 million subscribers, with their empire extending to TV shows, books, and podcasts. 
 In 2022, it all came crashing down after internet sleuths uncovered Fulmer’s extramarital affair with a Try Guys producer. The scandal broke the internet and Fulmer was fired from the group after an internal investigation.    
 Fast forward three years and on the debut  episode  of his new podcast (because there aren’t enough men with podcasts), Ned and Ariel reconstructed the timeline of the scandal and shared that they are no longer together romantically, much to the  internet’s  delight and relief.   
 Ariel also revealed, for the first time, that she found out about her husband’s affair from a fan’s message. When asked if she’s forgiven Ned, Ariel responded, “Absolutely not. How can you forgive somebody for lying to you, for cheating on you? No.”  
 Neither has the internet, it seems.  
 “Him calling it ‘the scandal’ and her calling it ‘your affair’ is all we needed to know,” one person commented beneath the YouTube video, which currently has more than 100,000 dislikes compared to just over 7,000 likes.  
 “I can’t believe he’s really interviewing her about him traumatizing her,” another wrote. 
 In an  interview  with  Rolling Stone , Ariel revealed the podcast episode was, in fact, her idea.  Some  have speculated Ariel predicted exactly how badly Ned would come across and that was part of her motivation to do the episode in the first place.  
 “I love that she lets silence hang in the air after he says something horrible or stupid and just fully lets him feel uncomfortable,” one commented.  
 Another added: “Oh to be a fly on the wall in the Try Guys office today.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410711/ned-fulmer-try-guy-cheating-podcast,"lace, new, thing",2025-09-25T19:16:15.746833+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91410711-ned-fulmer-try-guy-cheating.jpg","['material', 'cross_industry']"
Starbucks is closing stores and laying off 900 people in $1 billion restructuring,"Starbucks will end the year with fewer stores and fewer employees. But the brand maintains that  it’s all part of a greater turnaround  still in the mix. 
 Today, the company announced that its North American store locations will be reduced by 1% for fiscal 2025—landing the coffee chain at 18,300 stores total.  
 And it will be eliminating 900 jobs outside of its coffee houses (in other words, corporate and other functions).  
 The company claims it will attempt to place affected baristas into new stores, but Starbucks says, “For those we can’t immediately place, we’re focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages. We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.” 
 CEO Brian Niccol has been at the helm for a year now, where he’s been unable to break a six-quarter streak of same-store sales declines. He’s promised a  Back to Starbucks turnaround  centered on better store design, operations, and customer experience. 
 But as he faces the scrutiny of an impatient Wall Street, the former Chipotle chief appears to be reallocating spending to drive the company’s growth while offsetting overhead. 
 Closures today; growth tomorrow 
 A closer examination of the details around this restructuring spot a somewhat finer narrative than sheer cost-cutting—and Starbucks insists that Niccol’s aggressive growth plan, in which he’ll add to store count in 2026 and imagines reaching 100,000 stores globally one day, is still intact.  
 Speaking just last week at the Fast Company Innovation Festival, he  promised to add “hundreds of thousands” of seats  back to Starbucks stores. The company will have actually closed hundreds of stores over the course of 2025, but it’s been opening enough new stores to offset the figure significantly for this final announced tally.  
 In a  public letter  published to the Starbucks website on Thursday, Niccol argues that it’s the sort of fine tuning required to improve the brand. 
 “Our goal is for every coffeehouse to deliver a warm and welcoming space with a great atmosphere and a seat for every occasion,” he wrote. “During the review, we identified coffeehouses where we’re unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don’t see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed.” 
 When asked if store closures were disproportionately focused on union locations, Starbucks told  Fast Company  that union represented status was not a factor in the decision.  
 In any case, the larger restructuring does support Niccol’s greater thesis—that in offering higher touchpoint service, it will continue to raise the bar of expectations from its stores and employees.  
 As Niccol mentioned during Q3 earnings, “We plan to complete an evaluation of our North American portfolio by the end of this fiscal year to ensure we have the right coffeehouses in the right locations to drive profitability and deliver the Starbucks experience.”

"Fast-fashion retailer H&M group closed 135 stores, but its profits and stock are soaring. Here’s why","The H&M group is entering the fall season with style. On Wednesday, September 24, the retailer released its  third-quarter earnings  and reported an operating profit of 4.9 billion Swedish krona ($521 million). The H&M group owns brands including H&M, COS, Monki, and Arket. 
 Its operating profit marked a 40% increase year-over-year (YOY) and beat analysts’ predicted 3.7 billion Swedish krona ($393 million), according to consensus estimates  cited by CNBC .  
 The figures also marked consecutive quarterly successes for the H&M group, which also  beat estimated operating profits  in quarter-two. However, the H&M group now predicts that 2025’s quarter-four will yield less positive results due to the “increased impact” of tariffs.  
 Stock price rises despite tariff warning 
 Despite the concerning forecast, investors responded positively to H&M group’s current earnings. Trading on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the company’s share price (STO:HM-B) jumped 10% through after-hours and into premarket trading Thursday morning.  
 Other factors could have contributed to the boost in share prices. The H&M group reported that sales in local currencies had increased by 2% during the quarter.  
 However, the company notably reduced its store count over the previous nine months.  
 As of August 31, the H&M group had 4,118 stores, compared to 4,298 at the same point last year.  
 The company closed 135, or 4%, of its store locations over the first nine months of the fiscal year, 48 in quarter-three alone.  
 A majority of the closures were H&M and Monki stores in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and Africa. Only five stores shut down throughout North and South America.  
 These closures don’t necessarily point to a planned consolidation.

Exclusive: How Crunchyroll’s manga app will turn a new page for anime fans,"There’s no clearer sign of anime’s cultural ascendance than the box office haul of  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — Infinity Castle.  The film, which hit U.S. theaters two weeks ago, has pulled in more than $555 million globally, including more than $104 million in North America, making it a bonafide hit for Sony Pictures, which distributed it outside of Japan through its anime streaming arm,  Crunchyroll . 
 The movie’s success reflects audiences’ growing interest in anime. A survey from market research firm Dentsu found that, 31% of people worldwide said they consumed anime at least weekly, with a full 50% of Gen Z reporting they watch it. That’s translated into a boom in Crunchyroll subscriptions. The anime streaming service, which is home to more than 2,000 titles (including  Demon Slayer),  counted 17 million paid subscribers worldwide in May 2025—more than triple the number it had in 2021.

 Crunchyroll will soon offer those subscribers a way to go even deeper on the source material of some of their favorite shows, with the debut a manga reader app. The company shared a first look exclusively with  Fast Company.   
 
 Set to launch October 9 on mobile and October 15 on web in the United States and Canada, Crunchyroll Manga will debut with hundreds of titles, including the manga behind some of Crunchyroll’s top series, including  Jujutsu Kaisen ,  Kaiju No. 8 , and  Apothecary Diaries .  
 For subscribers to Crunchyroll’s $15.99-per-month Ultimate tier, access to Crunchyroll Manga will be free. It will be available as a $3.50 add-on for the $11.99 Mega Fan tier, and a $4 add-on to the $7.99 Fan tier. 
 It’s a feature that users have been asking for, says chief content officer Asa Suehira. “Crunchyroll has been doing a lot of surveys over the past few years and digital manga has always been the most desired feature on our platform,” he says. “This is compared to shorter content, video games, music, or even discounts or credits toward merchandise.”

 Building a bridge between anime and manga 
 From a user perspective, Crunchyroll Manga is designed to function much like the company’s flagship streaming app, with important connections between the two.  
 If a title in the manga app has a corresponding anime series on Crunchyroll, users can choose to start watching the show straight from the manga app. Their device will simply switch to the streaming app if it’s installed. Similarly, if a Crunchyroll anime series has a corresponding manga, viewers will have the option of clicking over to start reading it.  
 “There’s data saying that 40% of manga readers discover manga through anime,” Suehira says. “We want to create a new habit of discovery through manga, and being able to watch the anime as well.  
 Crunchyroll has been clever about how it entices anime fans who might discover the genre through other streaming services. Notably, it will license shows like  Jujutsu Kaisen  to Netflix, but exclusively stream the latest season on its platform.  
 Crunchyroll Manga offers an opportunity for it to replicate that approach in reverse. The service will include manga volumes for series that exclusively stream elsewhere, including  Delicious in Dungeon  and  The Summer Hikaru Died —two anime adaptations that Netflix exclusively distributes. Fans of those series will have sign up for Crunchyroll if they they want to read the manga. 
 The manga and anime apps will also be linked by user profiles. Any updates made to a profile’s content restrictions in one will be be mirrored in the other.  
 The main appeal, though, is the amount of manga fans will be able to access. Suehira says that by partnering with Link-u, which has developed digital manga infrastructure in Japan, “we were able to work more closely with different publishers.”

 Making publishers happy 
 Crunchyroll Manga is actually the second time the company has offered manga. A previous offering shut down in 2023. Suehira says part of that platform’s downfall was because Crunchyroll’s licensing agreement with manga publishers limited how much users could read. It also “limited the opportunities for us to work with the publishers,” Suehira says.  
 Crunchyroll Manga will launch with a library of titles from publishers like Viz Media, AlphaPolis, and Square Enix. Crunchyroll says additional publishers will be added in the coming months, including Shueisha, which publishes the  Demon Slayer  manga. 
 Part of what has gotten these companies on board, Suehira says, is Crunchyroll Manga’s use of a revenue-sharing model that compensates publishers based on user engagement, similar to how the anime platform pays studios.  
 Crunchyroll Manga also offers a legitimate way for burgeoning anime fans to read source material. Suehira says 15 of the top 20 internet piracy sites include anime and manga, and that manga represents 70% of global publishing piracy. 
 “We want [Crunchyroll Manga] to be a solution to the privacy market and really contribute to the ecosystem in Japan,” Suehira says, adding that the app includes features the prevent screenshots and screen recording.  
 Part of working with publishers means tracking a titles popularity, which can inform payments, but also potentially predict a future hit adaptation.  
 “[Publishers] want to understand how the crowd is reacting to certain manga or an IP,” he says. “Data on consumption and fan reactions are things we could work together with our partners in Japan to expand the opportunity—whether that’s turning into an anime or selling merchandise.’",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410256/crunchyroll-manga-preview-anime,"new, material, thing, future, latest",2025-09-25T19:16:15.748465+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91410256-crunchyroll-manga-reader.jpg",['cross_industry']
The U.S. could soon be headed for a government shutdown. Here’s how financial markets might react,"The risk of a partial  U.S. government shutdown  beginning next week is rising as congressional  Democrats and Republicans  hit an impasse over how to continue to fund the  federal government . 
 A shutdown could affect financial markets by limiting the operations of financial regulators and delaying the publication of key economic data. 
 How might markets react? 
 Historically, markets have tended to shrug off shutdowns. However, this time could be different. 
 A prolonged shutdown risks delaying or canceling key economic data releases investors use to assess macroeconomic trends, such as the monthly employment and inflation reports, analysts at Nomura said in a note this week. 
 That would mean the  Federal Reserve  is “flying blind”, making it more likely to stick with its own economic projections of two 25-basis-point rate cuts for the rest of 2025, the analysts said. 
 With investors unable to assess the extent of a U.S. economic slowdown, the Treasury yield curve could steepen further as rate cuts get priced in with more conviction, leading to a wider gap between short- and long-dated Treasury yields, TD Securities said in a note. 
 A lengthy government shutdown could also affect some market participants’ ability to conduct complex trades for which they may require regulatory guidance. 
 What happens to financial regulators? 
 While U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration had not widely shared its contingency plans as of Tuesday, a shutdown would likely reduce the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to a skeletal staff, according to its October 2024 plan for a lapse in government funding. 
 This would severely limit the agency’s ability to review corporate filings, investigate misconduct, and oversee markets. 
 Likewise, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would furlough almost all of its employees and cease most market oversight activity, according to its 2023 contingency plan. 
 Previous government shutdowns have caused delays in the CFTC publishing reports on traders’ positions in futures and options markets. 
 The banking regulators and consumer watchdog, which are not funded by congressional appropriations, will remain functional. 
 In 2019, a protracted government shutdown slowed down some of Trump’s de-regulatory efforts in part because of staff furloughs at the Office of the Federal Register, which must formally publish all steps in the rule-writing process, Reuters reported at the time. 
 Will IPOs be affected? 
 Yes. A shutdown would likely freeze the IPO pipeline. Companies planning to go public would be unable to proceed without the SEC’s approval, potentially dampening momentum in the equity capital markets, which have enjoyed an IPO boom in recent months.

Fermi America IPO: Stock listing date nears for AI data center and power company backed by Rick Perry,"As the rise of  artificial intelligence  continues, companies operating in this space or relying on the technology are finding that they have two inextricable needs: data centers that can run and process the AI, and access to ample energy to power those vast data centers. 
 One new company, Fermi America, aims to offer solutions for both these needs. And this week, Fermi announced its plans for an upcoming initial public offering and dual stock listings. Here’s what you need to know about Fermi America and its planned IPO. 
 What is Fermi America? 
 Fermi America is a very young company. It was only founded this year, just nine months ago in January 2025. The company is so new that  its website  is still a relatively barebones affair.  
 Given the youth of the company, it’s no surprise that the majority of Americans have most likely never heard of it.  
 But they have heard of its cofounder, Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who ran as a GOP contender for president in 2012 and 2016. After unsuccessful presidential bids, Perry was appointed as the 14th United States Secretary of Energy, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office. 
 In addition to Perry, Fermi America was also cofounded by Toby Neugebauer, a former comanaging partner of Quantum Energy. 
 Fermi America intends to be a provider of data and power centers that other companies can use to host their AI needs.  
 But I say “intends to,” because Fermi America doesn’t actually provide any services yet. Heck, it doesn’t even have any infrastructure yet to provide its services.  
 What Fermi America does have is a lease for 5,236 acres of land owned by Texas Tech University, which is where Fermi plans to build a “HyperGrid” in an undertaking dubbed Project Matador. 
 What is Project Matador? 
 Project Matador is the name given to Fermi America’s HyperGrid project. This HyperGrid will be a combined data and power center that other companies will pay to lease space on to run their AI needs. 
 In its  Form S-11 Registration Statement  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Fermi says Project Matador is “a multi-gigawatt energy and data center development campus” that will ultimately be called the Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus at Texas Tech University.  
 Fermi says the mission of this campus “is to deliver up to 11 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon, HyperRedundant, and on-demand power directly to the world’s most compute-intensive businesses.”  
 It says it will achieve this mission by using nuclear, solar, and natural gas energy to power the facility. By 2038, the company says it aims for the campus to deliver up to 11 gigawatts of power to AI data centers. It also says it expects the first 1.1 gigawatts of power to be online by the end of 2026. 
 However, all this is hypothetical for now. To date, Fermi America has not actually started constructing Project Matador. The company still needs to secure funding for the campus’s construction. It aims to raise some of that money through investments, including funds raised from its IPO. 
 Yet the fact that Project Matador is little more than an idea at this point is something potential investors should consider. As Fermi America warns in its Form S-11, “our business model is highly dependent on the successful construction, development, leasing, and continued maintenance of Project Matador.” 
 When is Fermi America’s IPO? 
 Fermi America has not announced a date for its planned IPO yet. This week’s announcement is for Fermi’s IPO “roadshow,” which is when executives of a company planning to go public meet with potential investors. Roadshows are designed to generate hype and interest in a company’s initial public offering. 
 What is Fermi America’s stock ticker? 
 Fermi America’s shares will trade under the stock ticker “FRMI.” 
 What exchange will Fermi America’s shares trade on? 
 Fermi America shares will trade on not one, but two stock markets. The company says it intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the U.S. and on the London Stock Exchange in the UK. 
 What is the IPO share price of FRMI? 
 An exact IPO price for Fermi’s shares has not been determined yet. But the company says it is targeting a price range of between $18 and $22 per share for its public offering. 
 How many FRMI shares will be available in its IPO? 
 Fermi says it plans to make 25 million shares of its common stock available in its IPO. The company says it will also grant its underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3.75 million shares. 
 How much will Fermi America raise in its IPO? 
 With an expected IPO price of between $18 and $22 per share, Fermi is expected to raise between $450 million and $550 million in its IPO. 
 How much is Fermi America worth? 
 Reuters  notes  that under the company’s current IPO price estimates, Firmi America is targeting a valuation of up to $13 billion. 
 What will Firmi America use its IPO proceeds for? 
 According to its roadshow announcement, Fermi America says it intends to use the net proceeds from its IPO “to support the continued growth and development of Fermi America’s business, to secure personnel, to increase its financial flexibility, and for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, procurement, construction, and installation of long lead-time items.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410687/fermi-america-ipo-date-stock-listing-near-ai-data-center-company-rick-perry,"technology, new, next, thing, announced",2025-09-25T19:16:15.749758+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91410687-fermi-america-ipo-ai-data-center-power-company-frmi-shares-nasdaq.jpg",['cross_industry']
This company is turning empty offices across America into farms,"Many of the office buildings  emptied by the pandemic  are still sitting vacant. A recent report from Moody’s Analytics found that in the second quarter of 2025, office vacancy rates were still  above 20% nationwide , and cities across the country are still trying to figure out what, if anything, to do about it. One startup has an unconventional solution: it wants to fill that empty space with crops. 
 Area 2 Farms  is a three-year-old company based in Arlington, Virginia, that’s taking the  concept of indoor farming  to unusual spaces. Its first farm, in Arlington, grows dozens of varieties of crops in a low-slung brick building tucked between a dog day care and a car repair shop. With a new infusion of venture capital, the company is planning to expand, and it’s looking to empty office buildings as potential future farms. “Part of our vision is that a farm can go anywhere,” says the company’s founder, Oren Falkowitz.  
 Backed by $9 million in new funding from Seven Seven Six, Slow Ventures, 468 Capital, and Animo, Area 2 Farms is planning to build 10 new farms across the U.S. in 2026. Falkowitz says the company is currently pursuing opportunities in Philadelphia, Charlotte, Nashville, South Florida, Orlando, Austin, and Raleigh-Durham, and Atlanta. His goal is to build indoor farms within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population.

 Proximity is the driving idea behind the company. Falkowitz grew up in south Florida and remembers a time when oranges were typically bought not at a grocery store but from the actual orange grove, directly from the farmers who grew them. Today studies estimate that  most produce travels hundreds of miles  before it reaches the end consumer. 
 “The production of our food just gets pushed further and further away,” Falkowitz says. “As a result of this distance, the stores are asking growers to produce things that are more shelf-stable, not necessarily more diverse or more nutritional.” 
 Falkowitz, who previously worked for the National Security Agency and later founded two cybersecurity companies, proposes a hyperlocal alternative. “We move the farm, not the food,” he says. 
 [Photo: Area 2 Farms] 
 The company’s pilot farm in Arlington produced its first crop in fall 2022. The company estimates it has produced more than 20,000 harvests since then, using a modular rack-based system that automatically moves crops through a cycle of mimicked daylight and darkness.  
 Planted in box containers filled with soil, the farm is able to grow kitchen staples like lettuce, spinach, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, and mushrooms, as well as more niche items like amaranth microgreens and purple shamrock. Rising 18 feet tall, the racks cram 200 acres-worth of annual crop growing into 3,000 square feet of real estate. 
 Indoor farming  is not new. Greenhouses are an essential part of the global food system, and Falkowitz notes that hydroponic farming has existed since the days of Babylon. “I would say it’s only partially interesting to be growing vertical, and it’s totally uninteresting or uninnovative to ship your products to Whole Foods, or Safeway, or Publix,” he says. 
 Area 2 Farms works more like those orange groves Falkowitz remembers as a child, but with the high-tech twist of its automated growing racks. Local farmers run the space and its customer base comes primarily from within a two-mile radius for weekly farm share pickups. “When we build a farm or we move the farm back to people, we want them to interact with it. We don’t want anyone in between the farmer and the consumer,” he says. 
 The idea has caught on. “We’ve been sold out for the last hundred weeks,” Falkowitz says. 
 That’s why he’s keen to expand Area 2 Farms’ modular farming technology to new spaces. “What we wanted the technology to be able to do is to fit wherever it could,” he says. “In order to build a greenhouse in a city you would need a quarter-acre to an acre of just land, and that does not exist.” 
 What does exist in cities is underutilized buildings and oddly shaped lots. Area 2 Farms is currently in the process of building its second farm on a trapezoid-shaped lot in Fairfax, Virginia, that’s been vacant for 20 years. 
 Falkowitz sees even more potential in the empty offices that litter cities across the country, and he says cities and real estate owners have been open to the idea of taking this farming technology inside former offices. “They’re just like, ‘have the space. We don’t know what to do with it,'” Falkowitz says. 
 Area 2 Farms is one alternative, and perhaps a second chance for buildings that might have otherwise gone obsolete. “At the core, we’re really focused on revitalizing underutilized or existing spaces,” Falkowitz says. “And that can be a wide array of shapes.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91409395/this-company-is-turning-empty-offices-across-america-into-farms,"fur, technology, new, thing, future, consumer",2025-09-25T19:16:15.750762+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/03-91409395-area-2-farms-in-empty-offices.jpg","['material', 'cross_industry']"
Whiskey missed its summer moment. Can it still win over Gen Z?,"Whiskey has always carried weight. Think crystal tumblers, low-lit bars, Don Draper pouring a glass after a big win, or Sinatra crooning with a dram in hand. These rituals and symbols have long defined the category, but in 2025 they may also have held it back. While other “dusty” drinks made surprising comebacks this summer (see Bacardi’s Breezer relaunch, Smirnoff Ice chasing Gen Z, even cask ale enjoying a 50% surge among 18–24-year-old pub-goers), whiskey didn’t seize the moment. 
 The idea of making whiskey more appealing to younger drinkers isn’t exactly breaking news. But it matters now more than ever, thanks to a new opportunity with this demographic. According to recent IWSR data,  70%  of Gen Z now drink alcohol, up from 46% just two years ago. This generation is curious, open to experimentation, and more likely to embrace unexpected drinks than older cohorts. 
 Yet whiskey’s sales have been declining in younger demographics, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. The urgency is clear: if whiskey wants to remain culturally relevant, it has to capture Gen Z’s attention now, before other categories cement themselves as the new “go-to” for younger drinkers. 
 Reinventing rituals without abandoning heritage 
 For whiskey, the challenge isn’t about throwing away tradition. It’s about loosening it up. A single malt aged for 40 years will always command respect, but it can’t be the only story the category tells. If Gen Z is to adopt whiskey, it has to feel approachable, flexible, and fun. 
 That’s where new rituals come in. Long associated with hushed reverence, whiskey can become a summer staple when presented in lighter, fresher serves. The Whiskey Highball is the clearest example of this shift. A tall glass, sparkling soda, and a hint of citrus: it’s whiskey, but social and sessionable. Suntory’s Toki has built its modern identity almost entirely around this serve, while Dewar’s has positioned the highball as an everyday cocktail in the U.S. 
 These moves show that whiskey doesn’t need to change what it is, it simply needs to change how it shows up. 
 Flavors and RTDs: breaking down barriers 
 Gen Z drinkers often don’t want to start with smoky or peaty intensity. Flavored whiskeys like Jack Daniel’s Apple or Crown Royal Peach prove that approachable entry points can feel fresh rather than gimmicky. RTDs, like Jameson Ginger & Lime or Jack & Cola, add portability and sociability, two qualities whiskey has historically lacked. 
 And it’s not just big brands making moves. New labels like Strutter, a peanut-butter-and-honey flavored whiskey with streetwise swagger, show how newcomers are breaking category codes. 
 Rebranding whiskey: from heritage to inclusivity 
 Whiskey has always had heritage on its side, but heritage can weigh heavy. The brands finding traction are swapping imagery of leather armchairs and oak panels for lighter, lifestyle-led storytelling. Jameson continues to frame whiskey as sociable and welcoming. Maker’s Mark is leaning into vibrant cocktails like the Whiskey Smash and Whiskey Spritz. 
 The message is clear: whiskey doesn’t need to dictate the vibe; it can flex to fit it. 
 A unified approach to the future 
 Whiskey has made progress, but it hasn’t yet claimed “drink of the summer” status. Why? Because the category is fragmented. Different brands push different experiments, which dilutes the impact. What’s needed now is a unifying symbol: one iconic serve, one joyful narrative, a category-wide push that says, “Whiskey can be light, inclusive, and fun.” 
 Heritage and lightness aren’t opposites. Together, they can future-proof whiskey for new generations. 
 Opportunity calls 
 Whiskey’s history has always been about time: ageing in barrels, patience, tradition. But in 2025, time is also about urgency. The summer of 2025 showed what happens when whiskey hesitates. Other categories rushed in and grabbed Gen Z’s attention. If whiskey doesn’t evolve quickly, it risks becoming the drink people respect but don’t reach for. 
 The good news is, Gen Z is drinking more, experimenting more, and seeking brands that are inclusive, playful, and authentic. If whiskey shows up in the right ways—lighter, fresher, more sociable—it can still win them over. 
 As a whiskey lover, I hope to see that happen. Because whiskey has all the ingredients to thrive with Gen Z, it just needs to play with a lighter, more joyful culture. If it does, the drink of summer 2026 might not be a spiked seltzer or a retro alcopop. It might finally be whiskey.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91405966/whiskey-missed-its-summer-moment-can-it-still-win-gen-z-whiskey-gen-z,"matte, new, inclusive, big, future, style",2025-09-25T19:16:15.751345+00:00,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-1-91405966-whiskey-summer-moment.jpg","['finish', 'test', 'cross_industry']"
Silicon Valley wants you to stop ‘rolling the dice’ about your future baby’s health,"By the time my son arrived in the world, both of us dazed and red-faced after laboring through the night in a hospital room, I had already started telling myself his origin story. 
 It had begun nearly two years prior, with a miscarriage, and then another. I was compiling a list of fertility clinics when he made an appearance on the ultrasound monitor, a flickering response to my quietly brewing despair. 
 I spent the long months of pregnancy that followed feeling like a cartoon character with a me-size thunderstorm threatening at every turn. Though my pregnancy was healthy, I was convinced I had to remain vigilant until my son was in my arms. When my husband and I visited my obstetrician nine days past my son’s due date, I wasn’t surprised to see an irregularity in his heartbeat. Less than an hour later, we were checking into the hospital to start my induction. Later that night, my son’s heartbeat dropped again, prompting a small army of doctors and nurses to rush the delivery room. But he recovered, my body stopped resisting, and then it was over. We sat together in the emptied room, my son curled against my husband’s chest, his tiny hat askew. Here was my family. 
 Do our beginnings matter? It’s the question at the heart of Orchid, one of a new wave of companies performing genomic screening on human embryos. Roughly 40% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles today include genetic screening, but in almost all cases, the tests are a relatively rudimentary gauge of obvious chromosomal abnormalities, with results similar in scope to a prenatal amniocentesis test. Orchid and its competitors, all of which were founded within the last decade, assess embryo health in a far more comprehensive, and potentially more radical, way. 
 For Noor Siddiqui, Orchid’s 31-year-old founder and CEO, old-fashioned origin stories, like my son’s, are the equivalent of “rolling the dice,” as she often says. She doesn’t yet have children, but she and her husband hope to someday have two sons and two daughters. To prepare, she has frozen more than a dozen embryos, and plans to retrieve even more eggs. In keeping with Orchid’s protocols, her embryos have been biopsied; the DNA contained in those four- to six-cell biopsies has been amplified; and the resulting genomic data has been sequenced and scored for chromosomal abnormalities, as well as cancer, autism, diabetes, birth defects, and hundreds of other diseases and disorders. 
 The most important parenting decisions anyone can make, Siddiqui argues, happen before birth: your choice of partner and your child’s genome. She views screening embryo genomes as a form of preventive medicine. “For the first time ever, parents can mitigate a massive amount of risk that was previously left to chance,” she says. She imagines that future couples will start their parenting journey as she did, by reviewing a data-rich, tastefully designed embryo report for each of their prospective children. They will be able to remove from consideration any embryos with serious and often rare monogenic conditions, such as cri du chat syndrome, and compare relative risk on more complex conditions, including intellectual disability and schizophrenia. 
 Siddiqui has no doubt that the practice will one day be widely accepted, and essential. 
 
 
 “ I started this company because I was pissed  I couldn’t have a baby the way I wanted,” Siddiqui says when we meet on a misty afternoon in June for a walk along the Chicago lakefront. It’s her first venture outdoors after a day in hotel meeting rooms alongside attendees of a reproductive medicine conference, where she was a featured speaker trying to convince an audience of physicians that patients undergoing IVF would benefit from Orchid’s tests. 
 Like many of Orchid’s customers, Siddiqui’s life has been shaped by genomic disease. Her mother’s DNA contains a de novo mutation that has slowly destroyed her vision; today, she is legally blind. At Stanford, where Siddiqui studied computer science as an undergraduate and in a master’s program, classes on  artificial intelligence  introduced her to the possibilities of applying deep-learning techniques to genomic data. The merging of computational science and genetics was a revelation. “I saw what happened to my mom,” she says. “I don’t want [my children] to suffer.” 
 Since its founding in 2019, Orchid has evaluated thousands of embryos’ whole genomes, at an out-of-pocket cost of $2,500 per embryo. (Couples who use Orchid screen an average of five embryos.) Orchid partners with IVF clinics to ensure that embryo biopsies are performed according to its guidance and then amplifies the embryo DNA for analysis at its own clinical labs. 
 Traditionally, IVF clinics evaluate embryos according to their morphological grade, which assesses the number and quality of cells in an embryo. If the clinic orders genetic testing, it is typically a test known as PGT-A, which can detect diseases like Down syndrome, caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. (The “A” in the test’s name refers to aneuploidy, or an abnormal number of chromosomes.) Orchid goes further. In addition to scanning for hundreds of rare single-gene mutations, it uses statistical techniques to generate polygenic risk scores designed to gauge an embryo’s predisposition to complex but often common diseases, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease. 
 Because polygenic conditions are influenced by behavior and environment in addition to genetics, the value of their associated risk scores is hotly contested within the research community. Being told one embryo has less risk of hypertension or coronary artery disease than another does not preclude a future diagnosis. But that hasn’t stopped couples with a family history of hereditary disease and considerable financial means from flocking to Orchid. “My inbox is all babies,” says Siddiqui. 
 But critics are circling too. Siddiqui’s observation that “sex is for fun, and embryo screening is for babies,” which she first voiced in a YouTube video in 2021, has become a polarizing catchphrase. A fertility specialist appearing on  60 Minutes  echoed it with pride, but ethicists wary of a designer-baby future point to it as a sign of Huxleian doom. 
 As she gamely walks the waterfront in a black blazer and sensible heels, Siddiqui’s frustration with the status quo is palpable. “I think it’s insane that we go to these doctors, talk to these conferences, and they’re grappling with, oh, this is too much information” to share with patients, she says. “Well, I’m going to have a lifetime of medical bills and a child who’s always going to suffer from an incurable disease because you didn’t want to look at a little bit of extra information. You didn’t want to spend five extra minutes with me telling [me] all the options for the most important decision of my life. And that enrages me.” 
 But an intervention like Orchid doesn’t just reduce suffering; it also introduces choice and control to the reproductive process in unprecedented ways. Through the ages, children have been viewed as a gift (sometimes an unwelcome gift, but a gift all the same). After meeting with Siddiqui, Orchid provides me with a sample embryo report to review. Looking at it, I have the uncomfortable feeling that I’m looking not at a gift, but at a product—indeed, a luxury product. Am I getting a winner or a dud? Does the promise of increased health span justify the cost of the service? The process rewards couples with the economic means to produce a multitude of embryos, and, by its very nature, encourages consumer-directed optimization. And, throughout, there’s the unspoken, but implied directive: May the best baby win. 
 
 When Jeff’s wife suffered  two early-term miscarriages, he felt helpless. The couple started looking into IVF, hoping to find a way to prevent further losses. 
 Jeff, a prominent startup founder himself, heard about Orchid through a colleague who had been advising Siddiqui. He was surprised to learn that some embryos with genetics that are not compatible with life can still generate high morphological grades on traditional IVF tests. When such embryos are implanted, they tend to miscarry. Orchid’s screening process offered a solution, combining PGT-A with scores for 1,200 monogenic conditions and a dozen polygenic conditions—including Alzheimer’s disease, which runs in Jeff’s wife’s family. 
 Jeff’s wife went through two rounds of egg retrievals. The couple spent upwards of $25,000, in addition to their IVF costs, to screen the resulting embryos with Orchid’s technology and welcomed a first baby last year. Jeff was so taken with Orchid that he became an investor. 
 “Everyone tries to provide a better life for their kids, wants to send their kids to the best school,” he says. “Why would you not want to give your child the highest probability of health success?” And as a society, he argues, we should be trying to “eradicate disease” and “improve our gene pools.” He hopes to see federal support for embryo screening, paving the way to lowered costs and greater access. (Eleven states require insurance to cover IVF and fertility preservation; no legislation currently addresses embryo screening.) 
 Perhaps not surprisingly, Orchid’s earliest and most vocal customers and supporters have been a who’s who of Silicon Valley elites, products of a culture where data is prized, longevity is hackable, and children follow after career success. Orchid has raised $12 million from the likes of 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki, Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong, and Ben Lamm, cofounder of the dire wolf–reviving startup Colossal Biosciences. 
 For Siddiqui, who completed the fellowship program for young entrepreneurs founded by libertarian iconoclast Peter Thiel, Orchid’s emphasis on consumer choice is a feature, not a bug. She has spent time with Orchid parents and their Orchid babies; she trusts them. “I think consumers are smart,” she says. “At the end of the day, what I love about the world is that the arc bends toward good.” 
 Indeed, if there’s a theme common among the leaders of embryo-screening companies, it’s a sense of befuddlement, even exasperation, at the wary reception they have received in clinical circles. Many of these founders, like Siddiqui, have been affected by genetic or chronic disease. When professional organizations like the American Society of Human Genetics caution against the use of polygenic embryo screening in clinical care, it’s personal. 
 Nathan Treff, cofounder and chief scientific officer at Orchid competitor Genomic Prediction, developed type 1 diabetes in early adulthood. His research, which relies on a database of DNA from adult sibling pairs, suggests that couples using Genomic Prediction’s polygenic risk scores for embryo selection can reduce the odds of their child having type 1 diabetes by at least 45%. “Don’t you think it’s unethical not to tell patients with diabetes that this was an option?” he says. 
 In June, Genomic Prediction announced a partnership with Nucleus Genomics, a genetic health company founded by another former Thiel Fellow, Kian Sadeghi. Genomic Prediction oversees the wet lab process by which embryos are biopsied and their DNA is amplified; Nucleus receives the raw DNA data and conducts its own proprietary analysis. 
 “We believe in genetic optimization,” Sadeghi told  Core Memory  podcast host Ashlee Vance in June. “We believe [that] if couples want access to height or IQ or hair color or eye color or alcohol dependency, they should have access to that. And the other thing is we really believe in the consumer deciding.” As Nucleus’s website puts it: “Understand your embryo’s future body, mind, and health,” starting with traits like male-pattern baldness and severe acne. 
 Orchid doesn’t offer information on cosmetic traits in its reports, and Siddiqui has consistently insisted that Orchid is focused on preventing disease. But the line between markers of disease and mere traits is blurrier than it might first appear. Height is a trait—yet pulled to its extremes, it becomes idiopathic short stature or Marfan syndrome. Plus, there are correlations between theoretically desirable traits and less desirable ones for reasons that scientists have yet to untangle. For example, educational attainment—a proxy for IQ—is negatively correlated with traits including conscientiousness and extraversion, and positively correlated with autism spectrum disorders and anorexia. 
 To some researchers, even Orchid’s focus on disease is problematic. They would like to see companies performing embryo screening connect their abstract polygenic risk scores to real models of disease in more concrete ways. For example, a risk score for obesity, which presents as a spectrum of symptom severity, is not the same as a risk score for cancer. “There’s no such thing as half cancer,” writes Sasha Gusev, a statistical geneticist and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in his Substack  The Infinitesimal . Orchid and its peers struggle to communicate these distinctions, at the risk of fostering false hope—or worse, false certainty—among their customers. 
 Companies like Orchid are still far too young to have a systemic impact. But already, researchers are hypothesizing about how embryo optimization might play out on a population-level scale. Patrick Turley, director of the Behavioral and Health Genomics Center at the University of Southern California, was lead author of a 2021 paper outlining problems with the use of polygenic risk scores in embryo selection. He foreshadows a world in which cost-focused nationalized healthcare systems, in particular, might lead the way in embryo screening. “What’s the cost-benefit analysis?” he asks. “If you could reduce someone’s diabetes risk by three or four percentage points, what does that mean in terms of lifetime medical spending, but also quality of life in the future?” 
 There is something undeniably appealing about de-risking reproduction and lowering lifetime medical costs. Siddiqui’s preferred metaphors—rolling dice, winning or losing the genetic lottery—make nature’s reproductive methodology appear haphazard, even capricious. Embryo screening, in contrast, seems like a safe and responsible approach. But of course, Siddiqui’s portrayal is incomplete. There is intelligence and optimization built into nature’s design, even if it does sometimes lead to loss. More than half of first-trimester miscarriages are the result of chromosomal abnormalities. My miscarriages caused great grief, but they were also, likely, safeguarding me.
