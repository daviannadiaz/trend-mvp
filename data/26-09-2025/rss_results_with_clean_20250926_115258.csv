Anti Social Social Club’s “No More Sleep” Collection Arrives With Bloody Logos and Horror Tributes,"SummaryASSC unveils its ""No More Sleep"" Halloween capsule collectionDesigns feature a bloody logo, Jason mask with florals and a pumpkin/roach graphicThe limited-edition drop launches September 27; prices range from $30 - $199 USDAnti Social Social Club (ASSC) has officially unveiled its ""No More Sleep"" Halloween capsule collection, bringing a spine-tingling edge to streetwear this fall. This limited-edition lineup is designed to reimagine the brand's signature silhouettes and iconography with a focus on classic horror and spooky motifs, spanning a wide range of products from apparel like hoodies, crewnecks and tees to diverse accessories including beanies, caps, an umbrella and even a popcorn machine.The collection features several distinct graphic themes. One prominent design pays homage to Jason Voorhees, where the iconic hockey mask is given a unique twist, being entwined with unexpected elements like butterflies and floral accents. This contrasting graphic appears across select hoodies, crewnecks, and a lightweight jacket.Another core visual sees ASSC’s well-known logo reimagined with a blood-dripping makeover in hues such as red, orange, and a novelty glow-in-the-dark finish.

"GoPro Announces New Product Trio, Including a True 8K 'MAX2' 360º Camera with Swappable Lenses","GoPro has announced a trio of new products including a hugely updated 360-degree camera, lifestyle-focused mini action camera, and an AI-powered gimbal that's not just compatible with GoPros (unlike its previous GoPro-only gimbal from 2016).And, interestingly, what GoPro isn't releasing this year might be just as notable: for the first time in over a decade, the brand will not be launching an updated flagship action camera this year, opting instead to focus on its new range and double down on last year's HERO13 Black.The all-new GoPro MAX2 leads the new bunch for the California-based brand, arriving as the successor to its original GoPro MAX from 2019. However, it's a successor in name only, because unlike its predecessor – which GoPro marketed as a 3-in-1 multi-use model – the MAX2 is a fully dedicated 360-degree camera with specs that challenge the very best from other brands in its category.Described by the brand as ""the world’s best, most durable 360 camera"", the MAX2 features dual lenses and can capture ""True 8K"" video – which, according to GoPro, makes the MAX2 is the only consumer-grade 360 camera to deliver the full 8K resolution in terms of usable pixels. This, it says, is unlike its main competitors in the category – the Insta360 X5 and DJI Osmo 360 – that are marketed as 8K cameras, but include non-usable pixels (such as those lost during the overlapping – or, ""stitching"" – process to create a 360-degree shot) to arrive at 8K. In further comparison to the X5 and Osmo 360, GoPro claims its MAX2 delivers 16% and 23% better resolution than each of its competitor's cameras, respectively.As well as its high-resolution, the MAX2 also features 10-Bit Color processing, GP Log encoding and six on-board microphones that capture audio in 360, affording both professionals and advanced hobbyists more control over the final look and sound of their footage. The camera's dual lenses are also fully replaceable and can be swapped out with a simple ""Twist-and-Go"" action, meaning should an accident happen (which is probably likely, given GoPro's extreme sports audience) the camera isn't rendered completely useless.Other features found in the MAX2 include the ability to capture 360-degree still photos in 29-megapixels, with the ultra high resolution allowing users to crop and zoom into their imagery freely. AI powers the new camera, too, with modes like ""AI Object Tracking"" and ""MotionFrame"" providing users with multiple options when it comes to content capture. The MAX2 is powered by a 1,960mAh battery optimized for extreme weather, making it usable in a wide range of conditions and temperatures. It also includes built-in GPS, a feature GoPro claims isn't available on another other 360 camera.Alongside the MAX2, GoPro is launching a new, miniature action camera that it's targeting towards the lifestyle crowd. The new GoPro LIT HERO is a small 4k camera with a built-in light – a ""Whatever, Whenever"" solution to your action camera needs, according to the brand. It can record 4k video at up to 60 frames per second, as well as ""2x slo-mo"". Like almost all GoPro cameras, the LIT HERO is waterproof and can be submerged up to 16-feet (5-meters). It weighs just 93-grams (3.28-ounces) and can record up to 100 minutes of video at the highest setting per full charge.GoPro is also – finally – releasing a new gimbal: the new GoPro Fluid Pro AI, a follow up to its GoPro Karma Grip from 2016. However, unlike the Karma Grip that only worked with GoPro cameras, the new Fluid Pro AI is compatible with everything from smartphones to point-and-shoot cameras weighing up to 400-grams (0.88-pounds), meaning creators on-the-go need not carry multiple devices. The 3-axis gimbal features interchangeable mounts, an intergrated fill light, and 18 hours of runtime per charge – power that can be used to charge your devices, since the Fluid Pro AI has a reverse-charging capability.The GoPro MAX2 and the GoPro LIT HERO cameras are both available to pre-order now via GoPro's website: the MAX2 is priced at £449.99 GBP / $499.99 USD and ships September 30, while the LIT HERO costs £239.99 GBP /$269.99 USD and ships starting October 21. The GoPro Fluid Pro AI gimbal will be available is dropping directly on October 21 and will be priced at $229.99 USD.

2026 Toyota GR Corolla: Evolution Comes in All Shapes and Sizes,"Toyota wants to make sure its improvements and upgrades are not only known but felt. Enter the 2026 GR Corolla, which has had incremental updates since its introduction in 2023. And after three years of refinement, the 4WD hot hatch is seriously impressive.⁠⁠Toyota invited us up to Napa Valley, California to test drive not only the 2026 GR Corolla, but also the 2026 GR Supra MKV Final Edition and the 2026 GR 86 Yuzu Edition. Key developers and engineers were there as well to walk us through all of the evolutionary upgrades and improvements throughout the generations. For the 2026 model year, the GR Corolla saw minor updates mainly in its body-in-white – the structural chassis on which the GR Corolla is built. Chief Engineer Naoyuki Sakamoto walked us through that key improvement: 45.6"" additional feet of adhesive bond. What may seem trivial to most in fact means the foundation of the GR Corolla is that much stiffer than not only the base model from a few years back, but also the hardcore GR Corolla Morizo Edition which had 10+"" feet more than the base on its own. The '26 GR Corolla also benefits from an additional air cooling duct at the front, feeding the engine more cool air for longer stints of track driving – this in fact was a direct response to Nürburgring testing and the need for it to withstand its 16.1 miles of track driving.Alongside the 2026 improvements, remember that 2024-2025 also saw evolutionary upgrades to the GR Corolla – stronger bolts that had larger heads and revised flanges are the small changes, while revised ABS, stiffer progressive springs, optimized air flow vents and even aluminum sheets to combat static electricity in the wheel well was all in the name of making the car feel more connected and purposeful on the track. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Hypedrive (@hypedrive)And with us testing the GR Corolla on Sonoma Raceway for the whole day, we can definitely confirm just how improved the 2026 MY GR Corolla really was, compared to both the 2023 and 2024 editions. The hot-hatch felt that much more nimbler, sharper, more direct and intact, while turn in at high speeds felt more controlled and flat. The GRC received more torque in 2025 – 295 lb-ft compared to the original Core's 273 – and that was obviously the first thing we felt, but we'd say it worked in unison with the incremental changes the developers applied throughout the years. If there was ever a chance to purchase a GR Corolla, 2026 is definitely the year to go for.During our track day, we also got behind the wheel of the GR Supra Final Edition, which is the brand's send off for the highly-popular GR Supra. We naturally gravitated towards the GT4 Style Pack edition, which saw aerodynamic upgrades as well as visual differences. We were quite indifferent to our white matte exterior paint model, but the aerodynamic trim pieces added to the front bumper arches and window edges – for wind buffeting – are proven upgrades especially for speeds above 100+ mph. The ""GR"" side vinyl may seem tacky to some, but we found it to be just the right amount of pizzazz to make the Final Edition stand out. Last but not least, we rounded out the GR testing with the GR 86 Yuzu Edition, which reminded us that we don't really need 400+ or even 300 horsepower; the GR 86's lighter body, balanced 50/50 weight distribution, mechanical limited slip differential and slick shifting manual gearbox plays so well with its ""low"" 228 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. It's true – power isn't everything.We're excited to see not only the GR Corolla being continually improved upon, but Toyota GR as a whole supporting its vehicles and constantly giving them attention. Some may see the technical improvements as minor but it's true that the little things really do add up.

Jordan Clarkson Brings His Signature Edge to ALDO,"If there’s a tunnel walk, New York Knicks' Jordan Clarkson is making it his runway. The NBA star’s athleticism and accomplishments on the court are certainly worthy of praise, but so is his one-of-a-kind style. And luckily, ALDO has taken note. The classic footwear brand tapped Clarkson to curate a selection of footwear and accessories emblematic of the athlete’s penchant for fearless fashion exploration, inviting others to unleash their creativity through daring, unfiltered self-expression.With the rise of cowboy core and the comeback appeal of timeless fashion staples, such as the city-certified loafer, the ALDO collection curated by Jordan Clarkson channels contemporary trends without compromising on craftsmanship. Maintaining urban sensibilities that translate from the office to the streets, its footwear options forgo conventionality in place of statement-making silhouettes — a nod to Clarkson’s bold, enigmatic energy. And what’s more daring than a man in a heel — a Cuban heel, to be exact? In conversation with Hypebeast, Clarkson opens up about his partnership with ALDO and what it means for the brand to spotlight him as a trendsetting aesthete. ""There’s a lot of noise in the footwear world, a lot of trend chasing. But what I love about ALDO is their look has always been steady and tasteful, giving people who care about fashion what they need to look good, and letting them bring the products to life with their own personal style,"" mentions Clarkson. ""This partnership means a lot to me because they trusted me to see the brand through my vision, and it just so happened that we have a lot in common. Our style is multifaceted - sometimes it’s understated, other times intentional, other times it’s turning heads.""Drafted in 2016 by the Washington Wizards and currently signed to the New York Knicks, Clarkson has made a household name for himself in a league defined by perseverance and excellent showmanship. Asked what memorable moments have defined his game, he mentions: ""When you’re playing all the time, it can be hard to pinpoint one exact moment because the season moves so fast. But when I do get a chance to slow down and reflect, what stands out most are the moments that showed how much I’ve grown - both in my game and as a person.""Off the court, the 2021 NBA 6th Man of The Year baller is nothing less than a showstopper. Known for his signature braids, black nail polish and refined, head-to-toe designer threads, Clarkson epitomizes modern tastes. There are no rules, just self-expression, and the more authentic, the better. In partnership with ALDO, the athlete’s edgy persona invites new interpretations of how to style the brand’s signature footwear. With Clarkson as the muse, the collaboration champions a new fashion vanguard and a cohort of young creatives and professionals who value fashion as a celebration of identity.And for Clarkson, the magic is in the details. ""Each outfit needs a different finishing touch to feel complete,"" says the athlete. ""Whether that’s a bag, a statement jacket, a sock, or a chain - I always look for one item that’s going to draw eyes and spark a conversation or make me feel more put together.""Highlights of the curation include “Guthrie,” a western-inspired boot with textured cowhide skin and a chunky block heel, available in ""Pony"" and ""Black"" colorways. The all-black version of “Guthrie” illuminates the shoe’s intricate embroidery at the back shaft while ""Pony""'s unique tonal pattern offers visual flair. The 1950s-style, rockabilly-inspired “Buckley” loafers feature contrast topstitching and a classic two-tone leather rendering emphasized by a contrast white overlay at the tongue. ""Zollo"" is a slip-on loafer style in a black monochromatic makeup, adorned with spiky, silver-toned hardware along the tongue and topline. ""Rocco"" delivers a chunky lace-up silhouette with an embroidered pattern engulfing the toecap. Appealing to a professional set, the all-black leather ""Bruguu"" and suede ""Hildebradd"" briefcases round out the curation, amplifying the brand’s business-to-play versatility.""Guthrie"" is a go-to of Clarkson's, currently in rotation during the globetrotter's travels. ""The cow print boot is my personal favorite - I’m sporting this pair in Texas, New York City, even in Paris. It’s a staple,"" says Clarkson.  Other footwear options, such as the ""Doublezero"" boots in khaki and black suede color options, prioritize daily utility and seasonal flexibility, reiterating the collection's seamless transition throughout the year. ""My style is very versatile. I get inspired by new trends and new designers all the time, and so I look for footwear that can either keep a look grounded, or bring something extra to elevate it,"" adds Clarkson. ""This collection does both. The styles are clean - a loafer or cowboy boot that you’ll want to wear over and over again - but designed with just the right amount of ‘different.’""In the accompanying campaign lookbook, Clarkson pairs the “Rocco” loafers with a suave shirt-and-vest duo and wide-leg denim. In another chic, all-indigo denim ensemble, the “Guthrie” boots in the ""Pony"" colorway add a pop of visual dimension. ""I just truly enjoy expressing myself through fashion,"" says Clarkson. ""Everyone has their own vibe, their own individuality when it comes to style, and that’s what makes it fun to watch.""See the ALDO collection curated by Jordan Clarkson in the galleries above.

Six lessons B2B brands can take from Nvidia’s playbook,"What’s the biggest company in the world? Apple? Amazon? Microsoft? 
 No. It’s Nvidia, which in early August became the world’s first $4 trillion company, overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Last week’s results were eagerly awaited by the world’s markets and actually helped push the S&P 500 and Dow Jones to all-time highs. By the end of August, Nvidia accounted for more than 8% of the S&P 500, the largest weighting for a single stock in the index’s history. 
 Yet, Nvidia isn’t a household name. It doesn’t make the devices in your pocket or the apps you use every day. Nvidia makes chips. Excellent chips, yes, but not unique in the way we tend to assume a $4 trillion product must be. Its success is not just a product story; it’s also a brand story. 
 B2B is often treated as B2C’s poor relation. When budgets are tight, brand is first to be stripped back, reduced to a logo refresh or a new color palette. Nvidia’s rise proves that’s a mistake. Its transformation from graphics chipmaker to the engine of the  AI  revolution shows how brand strategy can create enormous value. 
 Here are six lessons B2B brands can take from Nvidia’s playbook. 
 1. More than a logo 
 Nvidia’s  brand identity  hasn’t changed much since the 1990s. The typography has been updated, but the odd, retro eye-and-square graphic remains. Many organizations would have dropped it long ago, worried it looked dated or alienating. Nvidia’s decision to keep it reflects confidence in what the brand stands for and in the loyalty of its audience, especially the developers and gamers who value its heritage. 
 Many B2B brands struggle here. A new CMO arrives and the instinct is to “refresh the logo.” These changes are often driven more by internal pressure than by real market insight. In doing so, companies risk eroding recognition and alienating the very customers that anchor their brand. 
 Companies need to ask: What do our core users value from us? What signals show continuity and confidence? Consistency builds familiarity, and that in turn builds trust. 
 2. Own a story, not just a product 
 Nvidia’s two main rivals, AMD and Intel, have longer histories and strong product reputations. Yet Intel is seen as legacy computing and AMD as fast and affordable, while Nvidia is synonymous with the future. 
 This isn’t because Nvidia “started” AI, but because it positioned itself as the essential platform for enabling it, shifting from being a graphics processing unit manufacturer to the company powering the AI revolution, and framing its value in terms of possibility rather than price or speed. That positioning has contributed to a market cap 15 times AMD’s and 47 times Intel’s, despite smaller revenues. 
 Many B2B firms struggle to look this far ahead. Brand vision often gets tied to short sales cycles and annual budgets. The challenge is to set an ambition that stretches beyond the next quarter. Microsoft did this successfully with its “cloud-first” pivot. Intel seemingly failed to capitalize on the AI growth wave, falling behind AMD and Nvidia. Although it is reportedly working hard on a comeback, will it be enough to make up for lost time?  
 The lesson: don’t just describe what you make, own the bigger shift your products make possible. 
 3. Be more peacock 
 Brands are regularly the victims of trends. The more established and reputationally safe they are the harder it is for them to stay connected to new audiences while remaining true to themselves. 
 However, Nvidia has remained remarkably true to its central vision. It uses its core brand assets—the logo, the green—everywhere. This consistency reinforces recognition, particularly among its most loyal audience: a technically minded, brand-aware community that values the company’s history. Where some brands tone down their heritage as they grow, Nvidia has leaned into it. 
 Salesforce and Slack have both succeeded by sticking with distinctive, even playful, visual identities in a category prone to beige “professionalism.” In contrast, many brands caught up in the 2018 “blanding” epidemic traded characterful logos and flourishes for neutral sans-serifs, diluting their identities in the process. Often B2B brands should have the courage to lean into the brand assets that make them distinctive and unique, rather than feeling they need to follow the latest trend. 
 4. Make the brand an experience 
 Nvidia’s GTC (GPU Technology Conference) has been described as the “ Super Bowl of AI ”, stadium-scale events wrapped in the brand, bringing together developers, researchers, and business leaders. These conferences position Nvidia not just as a supplier of hardware but as the platform powering what’s next. 
 Most B2B brands don’t think about experience in this way. “Customer experience” is often a trade show booth or a sales meeting. Yet experience is where brand comes to life: through service design, digital platforms, physical spaces, and above all, people. 
 Not every business needs stadium events, but every B2B brand can look at the moments where clients interact with them and ask: does this experience reflect who we are? Does it build confidence? Deloitte is a good example here. Its investment in connected digital and service experiences has made it the highest-valued commercial services brand  by Brand Finance. 
 5. Partner for relevance 
 Nvidia’s partnerships—from Tesla to Disney Research to Google DeepMind—have put it at the center of conversations about robotics, art, graphics, and AI. Each collaboration reinforces the company’s relevance far beyond chips. 
 B2B companies often fall into one of two traps: chasing partnerships haphazardly without alignment, or avoiding them altogether for fear of losing control. But the right partnerships extend credibility, and relevance. 
 The lesson is to find partnerships that complement your brand’s value and purpose. Co-branded thought leadership, for example, can build credibility for both parties. Deloitte and Apple’s collaboration to accelerate enterprise mobility is a good example. The misstep comes when brands partner without clear alignment. 
 6. Build a human figurehead 
 Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has become a brand asset in his own right. Known for his leather jackets and unscripted keynote style, he’s built a following—even a nickname for his fans—which is unusual in the world of B2B hardware. His visibility has amplified Nvidia’s vision while keeping the brand rooted in the community that uses its products. 
 Most B2B leaders aren’t visible in this way. Either they avoid the spotlight, or they show up only in highly scripted investor calls. Yet charismatic leaders can create strong brand momentum. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce uses his personal platform to advance the company’s narrative. Deloitte CEO Joseph Ucuzoglu has also become a recognizable voice on leadership and the future of work. 
 For B2B brands, the takeaway isn’t to manufacture celebrity. It’s to encourage leaders to show up authentically, in ways that reflect the brand’s values and ambitions. 
 Brand is the differentiator 
 From the outside, many B2B products can look more alike than they really are: another chip, another service, another platform. That’s when brand becomes the differentiator. 
 Nvidia’s rise to the top wasn’t just about cutting-edge engineering. It was about confidence: sticking with distinctive assets, claiming ownership of the future, showing up consistently, building meaningful experiences, partnering with intent, and amplifying it all through visible leadership. 
 The lesson for B2B brands is simple. Don’t treat brand as decoration. Allow your brand to be vision-led. Nvidia shows that even in categories that seem invisible or interchangeable, brand confidence can drive both growth and value.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91398497/six-lessons-b2b-brands-can-take-from-nvidias-playbook-b2b-brands-nvidia-lessons,"technology, new, color, next, trend, big, future, latest, style,

Touchscreens in cars are finally on their way out. Good riddance,"For years, Mercedes-Benz has relied on touchscreens as the command center of its vehicles. Is it too hot? Tap the screen to set the AC temperature. Want to listen to the news? Tap. Defrost the rear window? Tap, tap, tap. While the automaker has retained some physical controls in its cars, its modern user experience is effectively built around the screen. 
 But that’s about to change. 
 Magnus Östberg, chief software officer for Mercedes-Benz, recently announced that the company would be centering future car design around physical controls instead of screens. “The data shows us physical buttons are better,” Östberg  told   Autocar  at the Munich motor show. He says Mercedes will begin integrating more physical controls into its digitally focused cabins starting in 2026. 
 Mercedes’ announcement is part of a bigger industry trend… 
 
 with carmakers like  Hyundai  leading the charge to bring back knobs and buttons to its cars. Earlier this year, fellow German automaker Volkswagen, also announced plans to fix its touchscreen problem,  saying  that it was “taking a step back to move forward.” 
 After more than a decade of car screens growing bigger and brighter, the auto industry finally seems to be acknowledging what drivers (and science!) has known all along: physical buttons are safer and more pleasant to use. 
 
 Why automakers went crazy for screens  
 You can partly blame Buick for this mess. The General Motors’ brand introduced the first 3-by-4-inch car touchscreen with the 1986 Buick Riviera. It turned out that drivers found the design distracting and cumbersome, so Buick eventually cancelled it. Still, it serves as an early glimpse of how automakers would eventually come to think about integrating technology into the driver experience.  
 Throughout the ’90s and early 2000s, automakers like BMW and Lexus began to integrate small, low-res screens into their cars to handle functions like navigation. But the touchscreen revolution didn’t happen in earnest until 2012 when Elon Musk installed cheap vertical 17-inch displays in his Model S. The sleek, tech-forward design intrigued other automakers, who realized they could cut costs by reducing the number of expensive physical controls in their cars.  
 And sure enough, lots of car companies followed suit. Throughout the 2010s, touchscreens became the default mode of interaction for carmakers across the price spectrum. But screens were not without their problems. Tesla’s reliance on electronic controls has lead to some high profile issues. The screens themselves started failing, leading to  a 158,000-vehicle recall  for the company.  
 Drivers, meanwhile, didn’t seem to like touchscreens all that much, and science didn’t either. Evidence began mounting that touchscreens, despite their perceived convenience, were actually not all that helpful.

 In 2022, Swedish car magazine  Vi Bilägare  conducted a  comprehensive study  of 11 modern touchscreen-equipped cars. It found that physical controls  dramatically outperform  digital interfaces for driver tasks. 
 Its testing revealed that a 17-year-old Volvo V70 with only physical controls allowed drivers to complete essential tasks in just 10 seconds, while modern cars with touchscreens took anywhere from 23.5 seconds to a disastrous 44.9 seconds to accomplish the same functions. 
 But going back to physical controls is not just about convenience—it’s about safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  says  any distraction that requires drivers to look away from the road even for a second is a potential accident. Touchscreens, by nature, require drivers to take their eyes off the road to navigate through multiple menu layers in order to perform simple tasks that once required an easy-to-find single physical button press or dial twist. As design expert Amber Case  says , “Because buttons are not fixed to specific locations, screens inhibit muscle memory and findability. Touchscreens compete for attention with the driving process, adding to the dangers of distracted driving.” 
 Back to basics 
 All this has lead automakers to reconsider their devotion to the screen. In early 2025, Volkswagen  announced  a significant policy shift, with the company committing to restore physical controls for essential functions across all future models. Design chief Andreas Mindt acknowledged publicly that the company’s touchscreen-heavy strategy had failed users. He  said  that cars are not phones, so they require a different interface. 
 Hyundai  also reversed direction in late 2024, when they  reintroduced physical controls with its Ioniq 5 . It came after a  2023 epiphany , when its internal testing revealed driver frustration with capacitive controls during critical moments. The Korean automaker’s research showed that touch-only interfaces create anxiety when drivers need immediate access to vehicle functions.  
 “I think it’s great,” designer Chris Kernaghan told  Fast Company  at the time. “I’m not dismissing touchscreens in cars entirely, [but] there are certain critical controls that are better suited to good old-fashioned buttons and knobs. As a designer, I’m all about tactile feedback whenever possible. It just feels natural to push a button and get an immediate response. You don’t get that same sense of control with touchscreens.” 
 Manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan maintained hybrid approaches throughout the touchscreen boom, preserving tactile controls alongside digital displays rather than eliminating buttons entirely. Chinese brands also offer hybrid a touchscreen-physical button UX, although some, like the Xiaomi SU7, provide it with an optional full physical control system  that attaches magnetically to the dashboard , under the main display. 
 Trend spotting 
 If I were a cynic (and I am), I would say that Mercedes took these steps mostly because there seems to be a reversal to this useless fad. Plus, regulatory pressure is mounting: Europe’s safety testing organization  will penalize vehicles starting in 2026  if they lack physical controls for essential safety systems including climate, signals, emergency features, and driver-assistance functions.  
 But Östberg explained that the company’s real-world usage data—revealed by its own cars’ electronics—pointed out that something needed to change. A Mercedes spokesperson told  Fast Company  that consumer feedback played a role in the shift: “We’ve listened closely to customer feedback and analyzed real-world usage data from our software-defined vehicles. Physical controls offer superior usability and comfort for many drivers.” 
 The spokesperson added, “The rollers and these physical buttons are very important for certain age groups and certain populations.” This may be true, but it’s a strange way to frame a decision that is ultimately about making cars safer for  everyone.  
 A solution in progress 
 The solution Mercedes has chosen starts with a redesigned steering wheel featuring “a host of rockers, rollers, and buttons” that will become standard across all Mercedes models going forward. This wheel will be fitted to all car models already on sale, with implementation beginning early next year. 
 Mercedes tells me that the manufacturer is reintroducing tactile elements like a rocker for the limiter and Distronic (its cruise control system) and a roller for volume control. These will all be on the steering wheel. The picture of the wheel shows a lot of buttons crammed in its horizontal axis, like an oversize PlayStation gamepad—a bit complicated, but definitely better than using the display. 
 Is this the solution to the problem? I always found these types of button-heavy wheel designs problematic. In theory, not having to take your hands away from the steering wheel is good. In practice, I find myself looking down to make sure I’m clicking the right button. Or missing the target if I don’t look. When asked about usability testing for the new GLC wheel controls, Mercedes told me the new steering wheel had undergone “extensive testing” as part of its development process, though no specific details about the results were provided.

 It’s interesting timing for the announcement. Mercedes has just fitted its new GLC SUV model with what is allegedly the biggest screen ever put in a production car: a 39.1-inch display called an MBUX Hyperscreen. It spans the entire dashboard width. As Mercedes-Benz design chief Gorden Wagener acknowledged to  Autocar , the company has “reached a point where you cannot make the screen much bigger.” Perhaps the industry’s screen-enlargement race has finally reached its logically absurd conclusion. 
 Mercedes plans to add more physical controls elsewhere in future cabins, though Östberg indicated this will likely be limited to SUVs because “in larger cars we have more freedom to package” and buyers of those vehicles “care more about buttons.”  
 When asked about expanding changes beyond the steering wheel, the Mercedes spokesperson told me the company doesn’t disclose details of future portfolios but continually evaluates “customer needs and preferences.” Maybe this is indicative that the company is still trying to balance cost considerations with user experience, rather than committing fully to what its own data shows works best. 
 Perhaps it’s FOMO, as the Chinese industry seems to be fully committed to displays everywhere and companies like  BYD  are  poised to dominate  the global car industry. In fact, Östberg hinted that different wheel designs might be used depending on location, explaining that “while Europeans like buttons, Asian drivers prefer more touchscreen and voice controls.” This market-specific strategy suggests Mercedes is prioritizing regional preferences over the safety and usability benefits its own data has uncovered.  
 Can AI fix it? 
 At the same time, Mercedes says it is investing heavily in voice command technology, with Östberg noting that voice command usage in the CLA has “tripled” among Mercedes drivers, calling the increase “phenomenal.” 
 This  AI  integration could represent the future solution to the buttons-versus-screens dilemma. If voice recognition becomes really good rather than  the current Larry David level of accuracy , drivers might eventually interact with their cars through natural conversation. This mirrors  the prediction of usability expert Jakob Nielsen , who believes that user interfaces will eventually disappear entirely as AI anticipates user needs. In such a future, the current debate about buttons and screens might be irrelevant. 
 Back in the real world, however, things need to change. More manufacturers should embrace the return to physical controls, even if it will cost them more to make those cars because of the complex electronics that rolling wheels and buttons require. Mercedes deserves credit for acknowledging the touchscreen problem like its VW colleagues have done and attempting to address a real problem with data-driven solutions. But there is still a way to go before we can say automakers are truly prioritizing drivers’ best interests. What will the cars of the future look like? Right now, the industry seems to be hedging its bets.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91405987/mercedes-brings-buttons-back-to-cars,"technology, new, next, trend, big, thing, future, climate, announced,

Trump made EVs temporarily cheaper than gas cars—and it boosted sales,"EV  sales just hit a new record in the U.S.: This month, they’re on track to make up 12.2% of new car sales, according to J.D. Power and Associates. Meanwhile, gas car sales dropped compared to the same month last year. 
 Buyers are racing to get new electric vehicles before the $7,500 federal tax credit goes away on September 30. When the Trump administration pushed to  eliminate the credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , it inadvertently helped nudge some consumers to switch to EVs earlier that they otherwise might have. 
 “There’s nothing like a deadline to get people paying attention,” says Josh Boone, executive director of  Veloz , a nonprofit focused on electrifying transportation. The organization has seen a surge of traffic on its digital platform that  helps consumers choose an EV . 
 The end of the credit also helped temporarily push EV prices down. In August, the average transaction cost for an EV was $44,908—a little less than the average gas vehicle, at $45,521. That’s because manufacturers added generous incentives to help sell cars before the deadline. 
 The tax credit has been in place since 2008, under the Bush administration. Now that it’s disappearing, EV sales are likely to plummet next quarter. Automakers are slowing production and canceling some models. But electric cars aren’t dead in the U.S., and sales are still likely to grow next year. 
 How much does the tax credit matter? 
 Even though the end of the incentive has spurred sales, the tax credit generally hasn’t been the deciding factor for most buyers, says Loren McDonald, who runs an EV data and analysis firm called Chargeonomics. “I’ve always believed that its importance has been overplayed,” he says. “For most people, it was more of a discount than it was an actual incentive to get people over the hump.” 
 Most people using the tax credit have had higher incomes, and probably could have afforded the vehicles on their own. That’s still the case now. “For a lot of people, if they’re considering the difference of a $50 or $100 a month payment, it’s like ‘I can deal with that,’ he says. “What it means is that people with lower income brackets still aren’t interested.” 
 In a recent survey with Morning Consult, analysts at Cox Automotive found that 65% of respondents who were in the market for a new EV said they would still consider an EV without the tax credit. “I thought that was a good data point to show that it’s important, but not for everyone,” says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox.  
 The number of affordable EVs keeps growing 
 As EV production scales up and battery costs fall, that helps push cost down. The number of more affordable models is growing. The next-generation Chevy Bolt will enter production later this year. The new Nissan Leaf will  start at just under $30,000 , with a 300-mile range. Slate Auto, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, will release an electric truck in the mid-$20,000s next year. (With the tax credit in place, it would have been  less than $20k .) Toyota is releasing a new  electric C-HR next year . Volvo has said that its new crossover, the EX60, is aiming to get as close as possible to  price parity with gas cars . 
 In China, it’s worth noting, EVs are already cheaper than gas cars without subsidies. Plug-in vehicles now make up more than half of new sales in China, with battery electric vehicles alone representing one-third of the market.  
 Technology continues to improve. CATL, the largest EV battery manufacturer, plans to soon release new sodium-ion packs that cost $40 per kilowatt-hour, 20% less than its current lithium iorn phosphate batteries (which are already cheaper than standard lithium-ion batteries). Automakers are increasingly adopting platforms that support multiple EV models, boosting economies of scale. All of this will help, although automakers are also facing headwinds from tariffs. 
 If you consider the total cost of ownership, many EVs are already less expensive than equivalent gas vehicles. They need less maintenance, and charging is cheaper than buying gas. Still, that’s harder to communicate than the sticker price.  
 “The auto industry needs to start educating buyers to be more like fleet buyers, which is they get out their Excel spreadsheet and they calculate the total cost of ownership of the truck over the lifetime,” says McDonald. “They need to do this with electric vehicles. The problem is, if you’re also selling gas vehicles, you’re basically selling against your own cars. And that’s always been one of the problems with the legacy automakers: if they go too far in selling how great EVs are, they’re basically saying, sorry, [gas cars] aren’t that good.” 
 The number of used EVs is also continuing to grow—1.1 million EVs were leased over the last few years and will soon be available for resale. The upfront cost of a used EV is already typically comparable (or cheaper) than an equivalent gas car. Those  sales have also been surging . 
 Some state and utility incentives are also still available. All of this means that even without the tax credit, the cost of EVs may not necessarily be a large barrier. Charging infrastructure is also improving, and the average range of an EV is already big enough that range anxiety isn’t the challenge that it used to be. 
 Automakers will need to get better at marketing 
 As the tax credit goes away, automakers may have to rethink  marketing . McDonald argues that car brands have overrelied on incentives and rebates from the government and utilities. “They’ve focused on all these incentives—not that it’s a really great car, and it doesn’t require maintenance, and it’s fast, and convenient,” he says. “My hope is that they’re going to do a better job marketing and targeting.”  
 One automaker he recently spoke with said that the brand is now beginning to target likely buyers, such as suburban families with a large garage and income. “They’re finally waking up and realized that doing Super Bowl ads is a waste of time,” he says. “What you really need to do is target the people who are considering a Tesla, and get them to buy yours.” 
 Automakers may continue to offer strong incentives next quarter to help offset the loss of the tax credit. “I think they’ll step in and offer more now,” says Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of data & analytics at J.D. Power. (GM declined to comment on its plans for this story, and Rivian said that it is still working through its incentive plans.) 
 Sales are likely to drop, and then rebound in 2026 
 EV sales will probably fall steeply in the fourth quarter, and likely the first quarter of 2026. That’s both because some sales that would have happened then happened early, and because other sales will be lost because the tax credit is no longer available.  
 But they’re expected to pick up again later in 2026. The same pattern has happened in other countries that phased out EV tax credits. In Germany, for example, the share of EV sales temporarily spiked to 22% just before the German subsidy went away at the end of 2023. At the beginning of 2024, they dropped by more than half. But sales then started to rebound, and by this summer, had grown to 16.8% of the market. In Canada, a federal EV incentive was paused at the beginning of 2025. Sales spiked beforehand, dropped, and are now starting to grow again.  
 JD Power expects that EV sales for this year will be around 9% of the total car market, similar to last year, and will grow in 2026 as new models arrive. Long term, analysts still expect steep growth over the rest of the decade, despite changes in policy.  
 “As we go throughout [2026], and certainly as we head toward the end of decade, we are still bullish on EVs overall,” says Jominy. “We do expect there to be a lot of new launches and expect the technology to continue to improve and evolve.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410845/trump-made-evs-temporarily-cheaper-than-gas-cars-and-its-boosting-sales,"lace, matte, technology, new, next, big, thing, consumer, buyers",2025-09-26T11:52:43.076929+00:00,trump temporarily cheap gas car boost sale sale hit new record month track new car sale accord power associates gas car sale drop compare month year buyer race new electric vehicle federal tax credit away september trump administration push eliminate credit big beautiful bill act inadvertently help nudge consumer switch evs early like deadline people pay attention say josh boone executive director veloz nonprofit focused electrify transportation organization see surge traffic digital platform help consumer choose end credit help temporarily push price august average transaction cost little average gas vehicle manufacturer add generous incentive help sell car deadline tax credit place bush administration disappear sale likely plummet quarter automaker slow production cancel model electric car dead sale likely grow year tax credit matter end incentive spur sale tax credit generally decide factor buyer say loren mcdonald run datum analysis firm call chargeonomics believe importance overplay say people discount actual incentive people hump people tax credit high income probably afford vehicle case lot people consider difference month payment like deal say mean people low income bracket interested recent survey morning consult analyst cox automotive find respondent market new say consider tax credit think good datum point important say stephanie valdez streaty director industry insight cox number affordable evs keep grow production scale battery cost fall help push cost number affordable model grow generation chevy bolt enter production later year new nissan leaf start mile range slate auto startup back jeff bezos release electric truck year tax credit place toyota release new electric year volvo say new crossover aim close possible price parity gas car china worth note evs cheap gas car subsidy plug vehicle half new sale china battery electric vehicle represent market technology continue improve catl large battery manufacturer plan soon release new sodium ion pack cost kilowatt hour current lithium iorn phosphate battery cheap standard lithium ion battery automaker increasingly adopt platform support multiple model boost economy scale help automaker face headwind tariff consider total cost ownership expensive equivalent gas vehicle need maintenance charging cheap buy gas hard communicate sticker price auto industry need start educate buyer like fleet buyer excel spreadsheet calculate total cost ownership truck lifetime say mcdonald need electric vehicle problem sell gas vehicle basically sell car problem legacy automaker far sell great basically say sorry gas car good number evs continue million lease year soon available resale upfront cost typically comparable cheap equivalent gas car sale surge state utility incentive available mean tax credit cost evs necessarily large barrier charge infrastructure improve average range big range anxiety challenge automaker need well marketing tax credit away automaker rethink marketing mcdonald argue car brand overrelie incentive rebate government utility focus incentive great car require maintenance fast convenient say hope well job marketing targeting automaker recently speak say brand begin target likely buyer suburban family large garage income finally wake realize super bowl waste time say need target people consider tesla buy automakers continue offer strong incentive quarter help offset loss tax credit think step offer say tyson jominy senior vice president data analytic power decline comment plan story rivian say work incentive plan sale likely drop rebound sale probably fall steeply fourth quarter likely quarter sale happen happen early sale lose tax credit long available expect pick later pattern happen country phase tax credit germany example share sale temporarily spike german subsidy away end beginning drop half sale start rebound summer grow market canada federal incentive pause beginning sale spike drop start grow power expect sale year total car market similar year grow new model arrive long term analyst expect steep growth rest decade despite change policy certainly head end decade bullish evs overall say jominy expect lot new launch expect technology continue improve evolve
Behind the inventive production design of ‘The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay’,"It’s not really possible to cleanly pin down the setting of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay . Written by Michael Chabon and published in 2000, the story takes place in Brooklyn, in Prague, on the battlefields of World War II, on the top of the Empire State Building, and in the imaginary universe of a superhero comic book.  
 The breadth of locations—physical and metaphysical—make for a rollicking read. But when New York’s Met Opera decided to stage  an opera version of the book , that globe-crossing, reality-bending narrative presented some very tangible challenges. 
 “It’s a big sweeping novel, so it requires an enormous canvas and a lot of locations,” says Bartlett Sher, director of the opera version of the book, which has just opened the Met’s 2025–2026 season. “We started workshopping it a couple of years ago, and I realized I can’t do this in the normal way.”

 To make those leaps in the real time span of a live opera performance, Sher and his team had to take a novel and highly complex approach to its production design. The Met tapped  59 , a multidisciplinary stage and experience design studio, to design the sets, lighting, and, crucially, video elements that reveal a narrative that takes place on multiple continents and within the pages of comic books.

 The story follows two Jewish cousins at the outset of World War II who create a comic book hero whose stories are intended to urge Americans to join the fight against the Nazis. Their comic becomes a hit, but their lives are thrown into chaos as the war unfolds, taking the audience from New York to Prague to the minds of comic book creators. 
 Part of the experiential design agency  Journey , 59 developed a production design approach that embraced the story’s location hopping. “The worlds start to be really musically distinct and really visually distinct, and then everything starts to collide together throughout the course of the piece,” says Jenny Melville, principal design director at 59. “It was quite clear early on that particularly the comic book world was going to have a major visual component to the whole design.”

 Melville has worked on operas and stage plays around the world, and 59 has developed video elements for productions like the  Broadway version of the Netflix series  Stranger Things  and the  Met Opera’s 2024 staging of  Aida . Melville says that as more and more performances  integrate video elements , production designers have to strike a careful balance. “Video design in opera is very much supportive material, an augmentation to the scenic design,” Melville says. “But it’s really critical to never overshadow the live performance on stage.”

 For  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  opera, video took on an outsized role, especially for scenes involving the creation of the comic book and stories from within its pages. “There are these moments where, really unusually for an opera, the singers stop singing and the video moments take over,” Melville says. 
 That’s partially a function of the narrative, which revolves around the creation of a superhero comic. The impracticality of having the audience watch actors imagining superheroes and drawing comics on stage led to the integration of vivid animated sequences projected on the set.

 The opera’s modernist score, by composer Mason Bates, also creates moments for the video elements to come into the foreground. The music juggles between the somberness of Europe in World War II, the jazziness of New York City in the 1930s, and a comic book world represented by electronic music. “Because there are these electronic music sections, it’s a really clear divide when we’re a supporting act, which is actually like 90% of the time,” Melville says. 
 [Photo: Evan Zimmerman/Met Opera] 
 The abundance of video elements in the opera presents its own set of technical challenges, especially when it comes to making sure the video synchs up with the musicians in the band pit and the singers on stage. “The timing changes every night, because of course the conductor and the orchestra and all the singers have to just do what feels right in the moment,” says Melville. “We’ve had to break all of our cue structures down into very, very specific time sequences.”

 “We worked very cleverly and carefully to make it work,” says Sher. “And that was fun, but it wasn’t easy.” 
 The hard work on  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  opera may pay dividends later on. Sher and 59 are already working together on another production, a musical version of the film  La La Land , that is going to rely on a similar level of video integration. “Everything we’ve absorbed on this experience is only going to help redouble our efforts when it comes to that experience,” he says.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91411036/production-design-amazing-adventures-of-kavalier-and-clay-opera,"lace, new, material, big, thing, designer",2025-09-26T11:52:43.078062+00:00,inventive production design amazing adventures kavalier clay possible cleanly pin setting pulitzer prize win novel amazing adventures kavalier clay write michael chabon publish story take place brooklyn prague battlefield world war empire state building imaginary universe superhero comic book breadth location physical metaphysical rollick read new york met opera decide stage opera version book globe crossing reality bend narrative present tangible challenge big sweeping novel require enormous canvas lot location say bartlett sher director opera version book open met season start workshoppe couple year ago realize normal way photo evan zimmerman met opera leap real time span live opera performance sher team novel highly complex approach production design met tap multidisciplinary stage experience design studio design set lighting crucially video element reveal narrative take place multiple continent page comic book photo evan zimmerman met opera story follow jewish cousin outset world war create comic book hero story intend urge americans join fight nazis comic hit life throw chaos war unfold take audience new york prague mind comic book creator experiential design agency journey develop production design approach embrace story location hopping world start musically distinct visually distinct start collide course piece say jenny melville principal design director clear early particularly comic book world major visual component design photo evan zimmerman met opera melville work opera stage play world develop video element production like broadway version netflix series stranger things met opera staging aida melville say performance integrate video element production designer strike careful balance video design opera supportive material augmentation scenic design melville say critical overshadow live performance stage photo evan zimmerman met opera amazing adventures kavalier clay opera video take outsized role especially scene involve creation comic book story page moment unusually opera singer stop singe video moment melville say partially function narrative revolve creation superhero comic impracticality have audience watch actor imagine superhero draw comic_strip stage lead integration vivid animate sequence project set photo evan zimmerman met opera opera modernist score composer mason bates create moment video element come foreground music juggle somberness europe world war jazziness new york city comic book world represent electronic music electronic music section clear divide support act actually like time melville say photo evan zimmerman met opera abundance video element opera present set technical challenge especially come make sure video synch musician band pit singer stage timing change night course conductor orchestra singer feel right moment say melville break cue structure specific time sequence photo evan zimmerman met opera work cleverly carefully work say sher fun easy hard work amazing adventures kavalier clay opera pay dividend later sher work production musical version film land rely similar level video integration absorb experience help redouble effort come experience say
AI passed the hardest CFA test in minutes,"Becoming a chartered financial analyst (CFA)—a certification that requires thousands of hours of professional experience, as well as taking a very rigorous exam;  Investopedia calls  it “one of the most respected designations in finance”—is no easy feat.  That is, until now . 
 Two years ago,  AI  models could only pass the first two sections of the prestigious, three-part exam. The essay section, however, had it stumped.  
 And yet,  in a new study  from New York University’s Stern School of Business and GoodFin, an AI-powered wealth management platform, advanced AI like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus passed the exam with flying colors. What would’ve taken a human  1,000  hours of studying over multiple years took AI a matter of minutes.  Just two years ago , analysts were saying that it would never be able to pass the exam. It’s a sign of how advanced the technology has become, and once again fuels discussion about how AI could replace even the most challenging jobs. 
 But Anna Joo Fee, founder and CEO of GoodFin, which contributed to the research but did not fund it,  told CNBC , “There are things like context and intent that are hard for the machine to assess right now. That’s where a human shines, in understanding your body language and cues.” 
 That didn’t stop social media from having all sorts of reactions. 
 One LinkedIn user called the news both an “impressive milestone” and “a little eye opening.” They  wrote  in a comment: “It doesn’t replace the human side of financial advising, but it does raise big questions about how the role of advisors and analysts will evolve in the near future.”  
 “AI passing the CFA in minutes while humans cry over flashcards for years? At this point, the calculator deserves a corner office,”  another  joked. 
 On the  r/CFA  subreddit, however, many were actually unimpressed. “Isn’t that like taking an open book exam? Unless your AI has memory problems,” one wrote. “Study: ‘water is wet’.” 
 While it may not be surprising to some, the study does make plain the rapid pace of change in AI’s capabilities in just a few short years.  
 “Right now, most of the conversation about work is about chasing the latest signal of what AI can do at work. It’s a messy, noisy, often contradictory conversation because AI is change that keeps changing,” chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, Aneesh Raman,  wrote  in a post.  
 He encouraged: “This new era is about the mind not the machine. Focus on the mind—yours, your teams, your organizations, your societies—and so many opportunities will unfold in the coming years. It’s not the robots that are coming. The humans are coming!” 
 A finance professional at PwC agreed. “AI won’t replace finance professionals—but finance professionals using AI will replace those who don’t,”  she wrote . Her advice is to be selective about the tools you adopt, prioritize use cases, and prepare to “work alongside AI.” 
 For now, though, this most recent headline is yet more fearmongering about the arrival of an omniscient entity plucking jobs from under our feet and kicking entire industries to the curb. 
 “It’s just another test a machine can pass faster, cheaper, and without breaking a sweat.  Let’s be real. This is bigger than finance,”  another LinkedIn user wrote . “This is a warning shot for every ‘thinking’ job we thought was future-proof.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91411134/ai-passed-the-hardest-cfa-test-in-minutes,"lace, matte, technology, new, color, big, thing, future, latest",2025-09-26T11:52:43.078701+00:00,pass hard cfa test minute chartered financial analyst certification require thousand hour professional experience take rigorous exam investopedia call respected designation easy feat year ago model pass section prestigious exam essay section stump new study new york university stern school business goodfin power wealth management platform advanced like gemini pro claude opus pass exam fly color take human hour study multiple year take matter minute year ago analyst say able pass exam sign advanced technology fuel discussion replace challenging job anna joo fee founder ceo goodfin contribute research fund tell cnbc thing like context intent hard machine assess right human shine understand body language cue stop social medium have sort reaction linkedin user call news impressive milestone little eye opening write comment replace human financial advising raise big question role advisor analyst evolve near future pass cfa minute human cry flashcard year point calculator deserve corner office joke cfa subreddit actually unimpressed like take open book exam memory problem write study water wet surprising study plain rapid pace change capability short year right conversation work chase late signal work messy noisy contradictory conversation change keep change chief economic opportunity officer linkedin aneesh raman write post encourage new era mind machine focus mind team organization society opportunity unfold come year robot come human come finance professional pwc agree will replace finance professional finance professional replace write advice selective tool adopt prioritize use case prepare work alongside recent headline fearmongere arrival omniscient entity pluck job foot kick entire industry curb test machine pass fast cheap break sweat let real big finance linkedin user write warning shot thinking job think future proof
"Here’s how Bryson DeChambeau, golf’s mad scientist, is using AI as a swing coach","Artificial intelligence is infiltrating every corner of professional sports, from  scouting  and injury prevention to scheduling. Now, it looks like golf has its most sophisticated  AI  adoption yet, and it’s happening in the bag of Bryson DeChambeau, the sport’s  most notorious tinkerer .  
 “We’re building an AI golf coach,” DeChambeau says. “Essentially, it will be a golf coach that, based on data, will be able to tell you exactly what you’re doing, how to practice, and how to improve your game. We can take a golf swing, compile the information, upload it, and within a minute, it will give me what’s different from my gold standard set of swings.” 
 
 The setup is deceptively simple: a smartphone on a tripod gathering data via video, paired with Google’s  Gemini AI  to interpret said data. Combined, they create a swing coach so intuitive that DeChambeau uses it even moments before teeing off in a tournament. 
 “The mental game is something I’ve always struggled with,” he says. “But whenever I become a little more confident and comfortable with my feel, my mental game goes extremely positive. And this assistant has helped me become a lot more confident with my golf swing.” 
 AI + AI = Coach 
 DeChambeau’s coaching system starts with  SportsBox , an AI-powered 3D biomechanical analysis app that analyzes over 30 key points on the body, club, and ball per golf swing. It measures everything from rotational range of motion to kinematic sequencing—the precise order in which different body parts accelerate and decelerate through the swing. This data is then processed by Gemini AI to turn those measurements into actionable coaching insights. 
 Think of SportsBox as the measuring tool, Gemini as the AI coach agent, and  Google Cloud  as the platform hosting it all. 
 The system starts by building and maintaining a database of DeChambeau’s optimal swings from recent years to create his “gold standard” set. So, when he hits a poor shot, the AI immediately measures that shot against his gold standard set and ranks the factors most likely contributing to the miss. 
 “We can take a golf swing, then upload it, and within a minute, it will give me what’s different from my gold standard set of swings,” he says. “It will give me a rundown list of the top [deviations] that are correlating to whatever’s causing me to miss.” 
 According to Granville Valentine, managing director of AI go-to-market at Google Cloud, it’s Gemini’s multimodal capabilities that bring the SportsBox data to life, creating the interactive coaching agent. 
 “Gemini is very differentiated on multimodality—the ability to ingest the combination of video, audio, text, and voice, and even livestreaming some of those capabilities into the model,” he says. “The combination of really deep video understanding plus core reasoning comes out in differentiated coaching guidance.” 
 The devil’s in the details 
 The granular nature of DeChambeau’s AI coaching reveals just how sophisticated modern sports analytics has become. The system uses Z-scores—statistical measurements showing how many standard deviations a movement is from the mean of a data set—to identify exactly where problems occur. Previously, DeChambeau would capture swing data but wait hours or days for analysis. With this technology, he gets feedback within a minute, allowing for real-time adjustments before a round. 
 “We were going through [the data] by hand in an Excel spreadsheet,” he says. “It was a manual process, very difficult. So you’re talking about months and months of trying to study the golf swing, now done in minutes.” 
 The data is also surprisingly precise. “Let’s say it’s a radial deviation at P6,” DeChambeau says. “That’s too much, meaning I’ve got too much wrist hinge, which makes the club come more outside in. So it’s very specific.” 
 For us non-DeChambeaus who got lost at “radial deviation” and checked out at “P6,” that’s where Gemini comes to the rescue. The AI’s ability to adapt its communication style allows users to train it to explain complex biomechanical concepts in terms appropriate for any skill level. Like other large language models, you can ask it questions, such as what specific terms mean, and as your understanding grows, it will adapt to give you more granular, technical data, meeting each golfer where he or she is at. 
 Old dog, new tricks 
 When he began using this technology earlier this year, DeChambeau found one of his fundamental beliefs about his swing challenged. For years, he says, he thought he needed to stay more centered over the ball—more on top of it—when hitting his driver. The AI consistently told him otherwise, saying he was  too  on top of the ball. 
 “It told me to keep swaying my chest just a bit back on the backstroke to get my center mass more  behind  the golf ball so I can allow the club to release through the impact more,” he says. “So that just blew my mind at how precise this assistant is. It was kind of a kick-in-the-butt moment of, wait, you gotta start trusting this thing.” 
 Eventually, he realized the AI’s objectivity as its strength. 
 “It’s unbiased,” he says. “It doesn’t tell you what it  thinks  you should do. It’s literally based on what you do when you’re doing your best, and keeps you in check with that.” 
 Democratizing elite-level instruction 
 The rapid evolution of AI coaching technology suggests we’re witnessing the early stages of a broader transformation in sports training. Valentine points to each new release of Gemini, which shows consistent step-function improvements in spatial awareness and reasoning capabilities. 
 “With each subsequent release, breakthroughs are happening,” he says, comparing Gemini’s current moment to the early days of Waymo self-driving cars, which needed time to become trustworthy enough for widespread adoption. “That level of trust—that level of breakthrough in the model itself—is now kicking over to a place where humans have the confidence to rely on this as a coach relative to a human coach.” 
 Still, Valentine says, the ultimate goal is not to replace human coaches, but to democratize access to elite-level instruction. 
 “I don’t think the objective is to get rid of coaches,” he says. “I think it’s to deliver access to those folks who don’t have access to coaches. There are lots of folks in the world who would probably be very well served to have access to coaching, it just hasn’t been available to them.” 
 At the PGA Tour level, DeChambeau believes there are further use cases for the tool, and that widespread adoption is inevitable once other players experience the results he’s seen. 
 “When these [other golfers] see what the capabilities are, they’ll immediately latch onto it,” he says. “Because it’s not about some theoretical idea. It’s about what works best for them as an individual. I can’t wait for a day when it’s a full-on coach, club fitter, you name it. We’re just at the beginning.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410129/how-bryson-dechambeau-is-using-ai-to-fix-his-golf-swing,"lace, fur, technology, new, thing, style",2025-09-26T11:52:43.079735+00:00,bryson dechambeau golf mad scientist swing coach artificial intelligence infiltrate corner professional sport scout injury prevention scheduling look like golf sophisticated adoption happen bag bryson dechambeau sport notorious tinkerer build golf coach dechambeau say essentially golf coach base datum able tell exactly practice improve game golf swing compile information upload minute different gold standard set swing setup deceptively simple smartphone tripod gathering datum video pair google gemini interpret say datum combine create swing coach intuitive dechambeau use moment tee tournament mental game struggle say little confident comfortable feel mental game extremely positive assistant help lot confident golf swing coach dechambeau coaching system start sportsbox power biomechanical analysis app analyze key point body club ball golf swing measure rotational range motion kinematic sequence precise order different body part accelerate decelerate swing data process gemini turn measurement actionable coaching insight think sportsbox measure tool gemini coach agent google cloud platform host system start build maintain database dechambeau optimal swing recent year create gold standard set hit poor shot immediately measure shoot gold standard set rank factor likely contribute miss golf swing upload minute different gold standard set swing say rundown list deviation correlate cause miss accord granville valentine manage director market google cloud gemini multimodal capability bring sportsbox datum life create interactive coach agent gemini differentiated multimodality ability ingest combination video audio text voice livestreame capability model say combination deep video understanding plus core reasoning come differentiated coach guidance devil detail granular nature dechambeau coaching reveal sophisticated modern sport analytic system use score statistical measurement show standard deviation movement mean data set identify exactly problem occur previously dechambeau capture swing datum wait hour day analysis technology get feedback minute allow real time adjustment round datum hand excel spreadsheet say manual process difficult talk month month try study golf swing minute datum surprisingly precise let radial deviation dechambeau say mean get wrist hinge make club come outside specific non dechambeaus get lose radial deviation check gemini come rescue ability adapt communication style allow user train explain complex biomechanical concept term appropriate skill level like large language model ask question specific term mean understanding grow adapt granular technical datum meet golfer old dog new trick begin technology early year dechambeau find fundamental belief swing challenge year say think need stay centered ball hit driver consistently tell say ball tell sway chest bit backstroke center mass golf ball allow club release impact say blow mind precise assistant kind kick butt moment wait get start trust thing eventually realize objectivity strength unbiased say tell think literally base good keep check democratize elite level instruction rapid evolution coaching technology suggest witness early stage broad transformation sport training valentine point new release gemini show consistent step function improvement spatial awareness reasoning capability subsequent release breakthrough happen say compare gemini current moment early day waymo self drive car need time trustworthy widespread adoption level trust level breakthrough model kick place human confidence rely coach relative human coach valentine say ultimate goal replace human coach democratize access elite level instruction think objective rid coach say think deliver access folk access coach lot folk world probably serve access coaching available pga tour level dechambeau believe use case tool widespread adoption inevitable player experience result see golfer capability immediately latch say theoretical idea work well individual wait day coach club fitter beginning
How Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D’Oyen McKenna is leading her aid org in the face of Trump’s cuts,"Following the Trump administration’s cuts to foreign aid, two-thirds of Mercy Corps’ U.S.-funded programs have been rescinded. CEO Tjada D’Oyen McKenna shares how she’s leading her team amid immense pressure—scrambling to find new ways to help those in need, even as she resorts to layoffs to keep the business afloat. McKenna reveals what she’s hearing from her team of aid workers on the ground in Gaza, and why she isn’t running away from burnout but embracing it. Like many business leaders experiencing political or economic volatility right now, McKenna is faced with a complex conundrum: fight, flight, or freeze.

 U.S. government funding accounted for half of your funding, right? 
 Exactly. 
 About two thirds of your programs were rescinded. I mean, it’s like an existential crisis, a true existential crisis for the organization. So what did you do? I mean, you faced a slew of urgent decisions. 
 They were urgent decisions, and I have to say it was very clumsy, right? Usually when you work with the government, there are definitions for every single thing, so very specific definition for stop or very specific definition for freeze. And in this case, the guidance wasn’t there. When they said we had to stop doing everything, our first concern was safety for people. If I have people in a remote area of a country or in charge of delivering food to a school feeding program next day, that community didn’t understand that we weren’t showing up the next day, and they certainly didn’t understand it was because the U.S. government told us not to, but we had to go to work. 
 Once it was clear what was going to be cut or what wasn’t going to be cut, we had to go about shutting down those programs across 40 different countries, lots of different labor laws to that. We consolidated some of our regions, we closed some country offices. We just got to work to say, “If the funding wasn’t there for that program, we’ll shut it down in the most responsible way possible and we’ll keep moving and then address what we have to do with the U.S. government to see what we can preserve, make sure our other funders are okay, and still be prepared in case if another hurricane or earthquake had hit during that period, we still had to be prepared to respond.” 
 I mean, the irony is your organization is all about responding to crisis when it emerges and now the crisis becomes you. And in some ways in some of these communities you’re sort of creating the crisis because they’ve become used to having you there. 
 Yes, yes, yes. And I worried a lot about staff safety, particularly in remote places where we were a source of survival for people where we provided access to food, and that continued to plague me. We’d hear reports from colleagues of government officials trying to stop their country director to make sure everyone got paid before they left. And my staff in Sudan, almost all of them are displaced from their homes themselves. So they’re working for us in temporary shelters, still going through the same problems that everyone else is going through. 
 And so this was a weird situation where our organization was the one that had to be the emergency patient, but we also knew . . . You almost felt guilty for feeling bad because people have it so much worse than you do. There were a lot of weird mental gymnastics that were happening for all of us. 
 We’re now months in, past that initial shock. How much do you look at 2025 today as an inflection point, sort of a new normal for USAID orgs like Mercy Corps? Are you kind of holding your breath in a way in hopes that, “A next administration maybe will reinstate things?” 
 No, we know nothing’s going back to the way it was, but we don’t know exactly what that looks like going forward. The other thing that was surreal is there was this demonization of aid or demonization of aid agencies. A lot of misinformation about the work we were doing and how we were doing it. And then there’s the third and fourth effect. So in a lot of places, we rely on UN airplanes to get in and out of certain areas, and so a lot of UN organizations we’re also facing the same U.S. cuts that we were. So we are still digging out of the aftermath. We know the world is fundamentally changed, and right now we are trying to embrace that and move into the future while also knowing the future’s still quite uncertain. 
  I have to ask you about Gaza. There are all the reports about famine in Gaza where you’ve had teams on the ground. Your Mideast director was on this show in October of 2023 soon after Hamas’s October 7th attack as the initial Israeli military action was underway. Are your teams still active on the ground there now? What are they seeing and what might our listeners be missing in the news reports that they’re getting? 
 We have about 35 staff that are still on the ground living and working in Gaza. We’ve had about 1,300 trucks stuck at a border that have not been able to get in. We’ve had some food in those trucks expire in that time period. And even without those trucks, our teams on the ground we’re working with water desalination plants and supplying clean water to people. It’s so dire right now. Our own team members are hungry. They are worried about where their next meal is coming from. We have a staff member that is able to go in and out, and she talks about the weight loss that she’s seen in her colleagues. About a million people are under evacuation orders in Gaza City. A lot of them, this is the fourth, fifth time they’ve moved. 
 And what’s different lately, which really concerns us, is that sense of hope is really eroded. I think people feel like they’ve been just left. This is as tough as it’s ever been, and our own staff are fighting for their own survival. We talk about the lack of food, but 95% of households there just don’t have enough water. And so someone said, “A choice you’re making every day is, do I wash my hands? Do I drink a glass of water? Do I bathe the kids? The little water I have, what do I do with it?” And we just can’t imagine. It’s just been horrific and to feel so powerless, especially when we know there are trucks waiting across the border that could get in. 
 There are people like us that are really eager to do the work, like my staff who are looking for food themselves, who want to get out and do things, and we just know it’s political will that’s stopping that. 
 I spoke to another humanitarian aid leader recently off the record, who shared that starting years ago, they chose not to provide services in Gaza because they were worried and believed that Hamas would inevitably infiltrate their efforts. And obviously this is what the Israeli government or military at least is kind of saying, did you have worries about that? Does that matter when you’re trying to just feed people? 
 Gaza has always been one of the most difficult places in the world to work. I mean, we all are under U.S. anti-terrorism laws. Our staff are vetted. We check the names, we check the lists because the risk of having a staff member be a part of Hamas is too great to bear. We have not seen mass aid diversion from Hamas. That just has not been our experience, and most of our colleagues have not experienced that either. So that has been talked about as a threat. You do see looting, you do see hungry people, crowds of hungry people swarming to every truck and you see children and people throwing themselves in front of trucks. The way to address people stealing aid or making food valuable is to flood the zone with food, and then it’s not as valuable. 
 I think more importantly, there have been anonymous Israeli defense forces in COGAT, which is the border authority officials saying that they’ve seen no mass aid diversion. U.S. government reports, internal former USAID audit reports said they have no evidence of mass diversion of aid. So we work in difficult environments and we all take vetting very seriously, but we know how to do this. We know how to work in these environments.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91411068/how-mercy-corps-ceo-tjada-doyen-mckenna-is-leading-her-aid-org-in-the-face-of-trumps-cuts,"lace, matte, new, next, thing, future",2025-09-26T11:52:43.080625+00:00,mercy corps ceo tjada mckenna lead aid org face trump cut follow trump administration cut foreign aid third mercy corps program rescind ceo tjada mckenna share lead team amid immense pressure scramble find new way help need resort layoff business afloat mckenna reveal hear team aid worker ground gaza run away burnout embrace like business leader experience political economic volatility right mckenna face complex conundrum fight flight freeze abridge transcript interview rapid response host editor chief fast company bob safian team masters scale podcast rapid response feature candid conversation today business leader navigate real time challenge subscribe rapid response podcast ensure miss episode government funding account half funding right exactly third program rescind mean like existential crisis true existential crisis organization mean face slew urgent decision urgent decision clumsy right usually work government definition single thing specific definition stop specific definition freeze case guidance say stop concern safety people people remote area country charge deliver food school feeding program day community understand show day certainly understand government tell work clear cut cut shut program different country lot different labor law consolidate region close country office get work funding program shut responsible way possible move address government preserve sure funder okay prepare case hurricane earthquake hit period prepare respond mean irony organization respond crisis emerge crisis way community sort create crisis have yes yes yes worry lot staff safety particularly remote place source survival people provide access food continue plague hear report colleague government official try stop country director sure get pay leave staff sudan displace home work temporary shelter problem weird situation organization emergency patient know feel guilty feel bad people bad lot weird mental gymnastic happen month past initial shock look today inflection point sort new normal usaid org like mercy corps kind hold breath way hope administration maybe reinstate thing know way know exactly look like forward thing surreal demonization aid demonization aid agency lot misinformation work fourth effect lot place rely airplane certain area lot organization face cut dig aftermath know world fundamentally change right try embrace future know future uncertain ask gaza report famine gaza team ground mideast director october soon hamas october attack initial israeli military action underway team active ground see listener miss news report get staff ground live work gaza truck stick border able food truck expire time period truck team ground work water desalination plant supply clean water people dire right team member hungry worried meal come staff member able talk weight loss see colleague million people evacuation order gaza city lot fourth fifth time move different lately concern sense hope erode think people feel like leave tough staff fight survival talk lack food household water say choice make day wash hand drink glass water bathe kid little water imagine horrific feel powerless especially know truck wait border people like eager work like staff look food want thing know political stop speak humanitarian aid leader recently record share start year ago choose provide service gaza worried believe hamas inevitably infiltrate effort obviously israeli government military kind say worry matter try feed people gaza difficult place world work mean anti terrorism law staff vet check name check list risk have staff member hamas great bear see mass aid diversion hamas experience colleague experience talk threat looting hungry people crowd hungry people swarm truck child people throw truck way address people steal aid make food valuable flood zone food valuable think importantly anonymous israeli defense force cogat border authority official say see mass aid diversion government report internal usaid audit report say evidence mass diversion aid work difficult environment vet seriously know know work environment
Why the Sunday Scaries hit harder when you’re a parent,"It’s Sunday night. Before kids, this was the time to nurse a mimosa hangover and zone out to  The Sopranos . Now? It’s a very different playbook. Sunday evenings feel less like a gentle exhale from the weekend and more like staging a Broadway play with a cast that hasn’t rehearsed and refuses to put on pants. You are simultaneously the chef, chauffeur, hairdresser, homework coach, and emotional support animal. 
 For parents, the Sunday Scaries don’t whisper “your inbox is waiting.” They shout: 
 
 Did you wash the soccer uniform? 
 Are there enough snacks for afterschool? 
 Is the social studies project due tomorrow or Wednesday? 
 Ugh! Did I RSVP for that birthday party? 
 
 The stress creeps up way before the Monday morning alarm. Workweek Ericka already has 15 Google Meets scheduled, but Mom Ericka must also make sure small humans leave the house with a full water bottle, completed homework, and hair appears combed. And unlike our carefree twenties, we can’t just order Pad Thai at 10 p.m. and call it dinner for two days. 
 The case for Sunday systems 
 Here’s the encouraging news: you don’t have to live in perpetual scramble mode. Research consistently shows that people who plan and structure their weeks report lower stress and greater well-being. 
 
 Weekly planning reduces rumination.  In a field experiment, people who sketched out their week in advance reported fewer 2 a.m. spirals about forgotten tasks and felt more engaged during the day. 
 Routines stabilize mental health.  Psychologists link chaotic home routines to worse parental well-being, especially during school transitions. 
 Planning boosts control.  Other studies show that planning is correlated with a greater sense of progress and competence—the feeling that you’re steering the ship instead of clinging to the side in rough seas. 
 
 Of course, let’s be clear: folding laundry does not spark joy. It’s possible that people who are naturally calmer are also more inclined to plan. But the evidence leans in a direction every parent instinctively knows: structure is sanity. 
 How to survive (without spiraling) 
 The trick isn’t to banish the Sunday Scaries—you won’t, unless you invent a time machine or outsource your children. The goal is to outmaneuver them with rituals that make Monday feel less like an ambush. 
 Hold a Family Staff Meeting Yes, it sounds corporate but it works. Ten minutes where everyone lays out the week: who needs poster board, who has soccer practice, who’s on snack duty. Cookies as bribes are encouraged. 
 Do Laundry Like It’s Gospel Uniforms, tights, hoodies, and beloved blankies must be washed and folded by 7 p.m. Otherwise, you’ll discover the only clean option is a Halloween cape on Wednesday morning. 
 Play Fridge Tetris Stock the fridge like a level of  Tetris : cheese sticks where you can grab them, sandwich fixings prepped, carrots visible so you can feel virtuous (even if no one eats them). 
 With a system in place, you can turn Sunday night from a slow-motion panic spiral into something approaching serenity. Because Monday morning will still bring tears over the wrong-colored water bottle, but if the bags are packed, the laundry is folded, and the fridge is stocked, you will survive with a little more calm, and maybe even brushed hair.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91408088/why-sunday-scaries-hit-harder-when-youre-a-parent,"lace, new, color, thing",2025-09-26T11:52:43.081444+00:00,sunday scarie hit hard parent sunday night kid time nurse mimosa hangover zone sopranos different playbook sunday evening feel like gentle exhale weekend like stage broadway play cast rehearse refuse pant simultaneously chef chauffeur hairdresser homework coach emotional support animal parent sunday scaries whisper inbox wait shout wash soccer uniform snack afterschool social study project tomorrow wednesday ugh rsvp birthday party stress creep way monday morning alarm workweek ericka google meets schedule mom ericka sure small human leave house water bottle complete homework hair appear comb unlike carefree twenty order pad thai dinner day case sunday system encouraging news live perpetual scramble mode research consistently show people plan structure week report low stress great weekly planning reduce rumination field experiment people sketch week advance report few spiral forget task feel engage day routine stabilize mental health psychologist link chaotic home routine bad parental especially school transition planning boost control study planning correlate great sense progress competence feeling steer ship instead cling rough sea course let clear fold laundry spark joy possible people naturally calm inclined plan evidence lean direction parent instinctively know structure sanity survive spiral trick banish sunday scaries will invent time machine outsource child goal outmaneuver ritual monday feel like ambush hold family staff meeting yes sound corporate work minute lay week need poster board soccer practice snack duty cookie bribe encourage laundry like gospel uniforms tight hoodie beloved blankie wash fold discover clean option halloween cape wednesday morning play fridge tetris stock fridge like level tetris cheese stick grab sandwich fixing preppe carrot visible feel virtuous eat system place turn sunday night slow motion panic spiral approach serenity monday morning bring tear wrong color water bottle bag pack laundry fold fridge stock survive little calm maybe brush hair
How Squishmallows (and their resellers) helped me through grief,"I was one of the millions of people who lost someone to  the COVID-19 pandemic .

I took shallow solace in my phone and turned to social media to numb me from the reality that I now lived in: a world without my dad. 
 One day, while mindlessly scrolling, I came across the  r/Squishmallow  subreddit, where a girl had posted her collection of more than 100 round plush toys. They were called  Squishmallows —round stuffed animals invented in 2017 that have become one of the most popular toy lines in the world, with  more than 100 million sold each year . 
 I was hypnotized. I expected that my dive into  the Squishmallow phenomenon  would be the usual two-hour rabbit hole, but spending time in that community was the first joy I’d felt in months. 
 After scrolling through endless photos of Squishmallow hauls, I worked up the courage to post. I asked if there was a cardinal Squishmallow, since that bird was my dad’s symbol for his own father. I was bombarded with compassion; even though cardinal Squishmallows were rare at the time, someone sent me theirs for free. That single act of generosity started my collection. 
 Stumbling into the Squishmallow world 
 But alongside kindness and joy, I encountered a darker side of the community: resellers. Finding the most coveted Squishmallows could turn into a fierce competition. 
 This wasn’t just my personal frustration. As a  doctoral candidate in marketing , I wanted to understand how communities like this function when outsiders exploit their passion for profit. That became the focus of my dissertation—the first study to examine resellers’ psychological and emotional impact on brand communities. 
 That research—which my colleagues and I published  in one of the field’s top journals —echoed what I had lived through as a collector: Resellers are one of the most consistent sources of pain for members of brand communities.  
 
 A Squishmallow reseller discusses his technique. 
 For example, when I heard that my local Hot Topic would be selling two Reshmas, the coveted  strawberry cow Squishmallow , I, like any rational adult, found myself outside of a mall at 6:30 in the morning. When the doors finally opened at 11 a.m., I sprinted to the storefront—only to find that I had been beaten by some people who had dressed as mall employees to sneak in early. I left devastated and cowless. 
 Later that day, I saw the same people gloating in local Squishmallow Facebook groups, trying to resell the cow for more than 10 times the retail price. I was heartbroken and angry; I swore I’d never collect again. And I wasn’t the only one to feel that way:  Across social media ,  you’ll find countless collectors   venting about resellers . 
 What is a brand community? 
 I didn’t know it then, but I had joined my first brand community: a group of consumers who form strong, meaningful connections through their shared admiration of a product. Brand communities range from  giant online hubs with more than 100,000 members  to tiny local groups that host trading parties in empty lots. 
 You might be in a brand community without realizing it. These communities can be created by a company—like  Harley-Davidson ,  Lego , and  Hot Wheels —or emerge organically from fans, like the Facebook group “ Walt Disney World Tips and Tricks .” 
 And they aren’t just about buying and selling.  They’re creative ecosystems , full of posts showing collections, inventive displays, and even goodbye messages when someone “rehomes” an item to another loving collector. Community members help each other solve problems, share leads on hard-to-find items, and sometimes even mail strangers a plush toy because they know it will make them smile. 
 But while collectors use these communities to exchange information, so do resellers. 
 The reseller paradox: A shared enemy can unite a community 
 Resellers are outsiders who buy the most sought-after items and  flip them online for a profit . They scout inventory tips, track hot products, and  plan their shelf-clearing strategies accordingly . And they infuriate collectors like me. Nothing sours the thrill of the hunt faster than seeing a shelf cleared by someone who only wants to use your sacred collectibles for profit. 
 After feeling emotional pain myself, I wanted to understand why resellers bothered me so much, and what they meant for the communities that had become my lifeline. That frustration became the spark for my research. What I found surprised me. 
 As a collector, nothing frustrates me more than to say: According to my research, resellers paradoxically strengthen brand communities. Yes, you read that right. Resellers help communities, but not because they try to help members acquire their desired items. In fact, my findings indicate that resellers inflict heartbreak on community members—which was in line with what I saw and experienced. 
 Resellers help brand communities because they create a common enemy that the community can rally against. When resellers grab all the stock from a store shelf, collectors turn to each other. They vent. They strategize. They share tips on where to find certain items, offer to pick up extras for strangers, and organize trades to help each other avoid inflated resale prices. Ironically, the people causing the most frustration also increase community engagement. 
 Brand communities are real communities 
 These communities reminded me that you are never truly alone in your darkest moments. Joining a niche community, whether for sneakers, trading cards, cars or even Squishmallows, can enrich your life far beyond the products themselves. It wasn’t the Squishmallows that helped me heal from loss; it was the connection that lived in threads, comments, and group chats. 
 I even came to appreciate the “villains” of the community—resellers—for their role in bringing people together. Although I still think I deserve that strawberry cow more than they did.

The Xiaomi Pad Mini is the first tablet that can compete with an iPad,"Almost as soon as the first iPad was announced, a range of competitors sprung up in an attempt to become the “iPad killer.” Devices like the Motorola Xoom, BlackBerry PlayBook, and HP TouchPad all put another spin on the formula but couldn’t come close to the iPad’s blend of performance and App Store dominance. 
 Android tablets are still around today, of course, but most manufacturers don’t push them too hard. They’re all fine at doing tablet things like watching videos, and they’re all worse than the iPad when it comes to the app ecosystem. In recent years I’ve used some great hardware from Xiaomi in particular that I still wouldn’t outright recommend over an iPad. 
 Xiaomi’s latest, though, is straight-up better than its Apple equivalent. 
 
 The Xiaomi Pad Mini feels like an exercise in picking low-hanging fruit: in this case, the iPad mini. Apple’s smallest tablet is often neglected and rarely updated, leaving several open goals for competitors. In this case, Xiaomi has turned in a better design with better performance, and critically in a form factor where Apple’s software advantages are less relevant. 
 Added ports 
 This tablet isn’t going to stun anyone with its originality—it pretty much looks like an iPad mini. It does have one neat trick, though, by placing USB-C ports along both the bottom edge and one of the sides you can easily charge it in a dock or while using it for video. (Apple apparently considered the same idea for the original iPad before deciding against it.) 
 [Photo: Xiaomi] 
 The Xiaomi Pad Mini runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 processor, the chipmaker’s current top-end mobile system on a chip (SoC) and one that’s at least in the same ballpark as the two-year-old A17 Pro in the iPad mini, if not faster. Performance is excellent, and Xiaomi also offers up to 12GB of RAM while the iPad mini is stuck on 8GB. 
 Superior screen 
 The screen is where Xiaomi really pulls away from Apple. This is an 8.8-inch 3008-by-1880-pixel LCD with a 16:10 aspect ratio; the difference in size to the 8.3-inch iPad mini is mostly that the Xiaomi has thinner bezels and is slightly wider in landscape. Critically, it refreshes at up to 165Hz while the iPad mini is still stuck on 60Hz, which is very jarring for anyone who’s gotten used to the much smoother frame rates on the iPhone and almost every Android phone in recent years. That was the main reason I sold my own iPad mini a while back.

 HyperOS, which is Xiaomi’s custom version of Android, looks and works similarly to iOS, but Apple actually moved in the direction of its system of multitasking and resizing windows with this year’s iPadOS 26. While Android apps still can’t compete with the iPad in terms of quantity or quality, how much  productivity  are you planning to get out of an 8-inch tablet in the first place?  
 Like a really big phone 
 The Xiaomi Pad Mini handles simple multitasking with ease, and its aspect ratio is well-suited for most Android apps. Since you can hold it in one hand and the screen is relatively tall, apps like Instagram work fine in portrait orientation—it’s basically like using a really big phone. The aspect ratio is also better suited to most video content than the 3:2 iPad mini, meaning you’ll get a bigger picture with smaller black borders. 
 Overall, this is a great tablet for watching videos, reading ebooks, scrolling social media, and browsing the web. You know, tablet things. It handles all of these tasks at least as well as the iPad mini unless you have a need for a very specific iPad app. 
 A caveat 
 There is one slightly bizarre caveat, which is the lack of any true biometric authentication. You can use your face to unlock the tablet through the selfie camera, which works better than it used to and didn’t get fooled when I tried to use a picture of my face, but that’s still not as secure as a fingerprint reader and doesn’t work in the dark. 
 That could be a deal-breaker for many. Touch ID isn’t exactly a great experience on the iPad mini, but surely a fingerprint scanner would have been a low-cost, worthwhile inclusion here for convenience and peace of mind.

 Still, I can put up with sometimes needing to enter a PIN in exchange for all the ways that this is simply a better product. I would rather use this than the iPad it’s competing with, which is the first time I’ve ever been able to say that about an Android tablet. 
 And that’s before I even mention the pricing, which starts at $429 for a model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The iPad mini, on the other hand, costs $499 for 8GB of RAM and half the amount of storage; the 256GB model is $599. 
 It’s not like Apple isn’t capable of making the iPad mini better value for the money—it just doesn’t particularly care to. This is what can happen when companies keep outdated devices on shelves at high prices. Mini tablets clearly aren’t the most critical product category in the world, but for the first time in a long while, Apple doesn’t make the best one.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410365/xiaomi-pad-mini-ipad-competitor,"lace, big, thing, announced, latest",2025-09-26T11:52:43.082966+00:00,xiaomi pad mini tablet compete ipad soon ipad announce range competitor spring attempt ipad killer device like motorola xoom blackberry playbook touchpad spin formula come close ipad blend performance app store dominance android tablet today course manufacturer push hard fine tablet thing like watch video bad ipad come app ecosystem recent year great hardware xiaomi particular outright recommend ipad xiaomi late straight well apple equivalent xiaomi pad mini feel like exercise pick low hang fruit case ipad mini apple small tablet neglect rarely update leave open goal competitor case xiaomi turn well design well performance critically form factor apple software advantage relevant add port tablet stun originality pretty look like ipad mini neat trick place usb port edge side easily charge dock video apple apparently consider idea original ipad decide photo xiaomi xiaomi pad mini run mediatek dimensity processor chipmaker current end mobile system chip soc ballpark year old pro ipad mini fast performance excellent xiaomi offer ram ipad mini stick superior screen screen xiaomi pull away apple inch pixel lcd aspect ratio difference size inch ipad mini xiaomi thin bezel slightly wide landscape critically refresh ipad mini stick jarring get smoother frame rate iphone android phone recent year main reason sell ipad mini photo xiaomi hyperos xiaomi custom version android look work similarly ios apple actually move direction system multitaske resize window year ipados android app compete ipad term quantity quality productivity plan inch tablet place like big phone xiaomi pad mini handle simple multitaske ease aspect ratio suited android app hold hand screen relatively tall app like instagram work fine portrait orientation basically like big phone aspect ratio well suited video content ipad mini mean big picture small black border overall great tablet watch video read ebook scroll social medium browse web know tablet thing handle task ipad mini need specific ipad app caveat slightly bizarre caveat lack true biometric authentication use face unlock tablet selfie camera work well fool try use picture face secure fingerprint reader work dark deal breaker touch exactly great experience ipad mini surely fingerprint scanner low cost worthwhile inclusion convenience peace mind photo xiaomi need enter pin exchange way simply well product use ipad compete time able android tablet mention pricing start model ram storage ipad mini hand cost ram half storage model like apple capable make ipad mini well value money particularly care happen company outdated device shelf high price mini tablet clearly critical product category world time long apple good
How to integrate integrity into your company culture,"According to a recent  study  conducted by the global consulting firm, EY, 97% of respondents reported that it is important for companies to act with integrity. Many companies tout integrity as a core principle of their organizations in an attempt to reassure customers, employees, and the wider public that their organization “plays by the rules.” By some  estimates , integrity is ranked as one of the most cited corporate core values, with over 80% of companies listing integrity as a core value. 
 But simply including integrity on your list of core values and mounting that list on a plaque on a wall (as many companies do) won’t positively influence your culture unless your core values are fully embraced and lived by employees each and every day. After all, Enron was once the darling of corporate America and a supposedly stellar business success story—until news broke that Enron had engaged in what would turn out to be one of the biggest  accounting scandals  in U.S. history. 
 Here’s why listing “integrity” as a core value and getting employees to live with integrity in the workplace can pose a challenge—even for companies with the best of intentions. 
 A few years ago, the CEO and chairperson of a large financial institution were caught with their hands in the proverbial cookie jar, engaged in what could be described, at best, as questionable behavior. When the media asked the chairperson if what she and the CEO had done was aligned with the company’s core value of integrity, the chairperson replied, “Integrity means different things to different people.” 
 The media and the public were outraged by the response. But, y’know what? The chairperson was right! Integrity  does  mean different things to different people when it comes to business practices. 
 Here are three steps to take if you want to build a company where everyone understands exactly what integrity means to the organization and exactly how to demonstrate integrity in the workplace. 
 1. Define what integrity means for your company 
 An organization’s perspective on the topic of integrity most often comes from the leadership of that organization, and their various versions of integrity are often reflected in corporate policies.  
 For instance, ice cream chain Ben and Jerry’s version of integrity is reflected in their  policy  to only use fair trade–certified ingredients, ensuring that farmers along their supply chain are paid a fair price for their products. Chipmakers like  Intel  demonstrate their version of integrity by avoiding using “conflict minerals” that are mined under conditions that could be considered to be abuses of human rights.  The Body Shop  demonstrates its version of integrity by committing to never testing its products on animals. 
 Some companies whose very business models, products, services, or waste may be viewed by others as causing harm to the communities in which they operate try to demonstrate integrity by engaging in acts of restitution. For instance, timber company  Hampton Lumber  plants three trees for every tree it harvests. 
 Outdoor clothing company Patagonia, known not only for the quality of its products, but also for its  efforts to minimize damage  to the environment,  donates 1% of revenue  to environmental groups. (Despite these actions, some critics insist that the acts of restitution pale in comparison to the destruction caused by the companies and even accuse these companies of “greenwashing”—a deceptive practice designed to paint organizations as being more environmentally conscious than they are.) 
 But, demonstrating “boardroom integrity” through corporate policies isn’t enough to qualify a company as being one that acts with integrity. Companies also need to demonstrate integrity at the grassroots level. It makes little sense to list “integrity” as a company core value unless that commitment to integrity permeates every corner of the organization on an individual, team or departmental level. 
 2. Clarify what integrity means for your employees 
 So, since integrity may mean different things to different people, how can a company’s employees truly commit to integrity as a core value?  There’s no easy answer to that question, but one way to stay within the boundaries of ethical behavior is to use “the social media test” where you instruct your employees to ask themselves, “would I be comfortable if this behavior, action, or decision were to be reported on social media (or in the newspaper) for everyone to see?” If the answer is “no” to this litmus test, then deep down in their hearts, they probably recognize that whatever they are considering probably isn’t aligned with the principle of integrity. 
 Another way to clarify to your employees how to act with integrity in the workplace is to articulate clear behavioral expectations expressed not in abstract concepts but in clear, crisp, and concise language, using what I refer to as the “even if” principle to make it crystal clear that your organization values integrity over the potential short-term benefits of acting unethically. For instance, members of your organization’s sales department might be told: “Integrity means never misrepresenting a product to close a deal, even if it means losing a sale.” 
 Consultants that provide services on an hourly rate to clients might be instructed to never overestimate or bill clients for time not spent on the account—even if that means not hitting monthly billing targets. Quality control managers at a company that manufacture parts may be told in no uncertain terms to never ship faulty products—even if a customer might never notice the defects. 
 3. Take Accountability Seriously 
 Next, it’s important to hold employees (especially leadership) accountable for these standards.   
 One way to hold people accountable is through the use of independent oversight—such as an empowered board of directors, ethics committees, or external auditors. To be effective, these bodies must have the authority to investigate ethical concerns, insist on transparency, reward employees for acting with integrity, and apply consequences to those who violate their company’s standards for acting with integrity. Most importantly, these bodies must not be influenced by internal politics and should not be able to be fired on the whims of the leadership team who they are holding accountable. Ideally, these oversight bodies should be proactive, with audits that identify potential conflicts early enough to prevent ethical mischief. 
 Another way to hold leaders accountable is to create a culture where employees at all levels feel safe reporting ethical concerns without fear of reprisal. Anonymous reporting and whistleblowing channels can help identify problems that leadership might otherwise miss—or worse, knowingly condone. 
 The desire to operate a company that acts with integrity is a noble one—but, as we have seen, one that is fraught with challenges—particularly because acting with integrity means different things to different people. No wonder  research  shows that just 23% of U.S. employees strongly agree that they can apply their organization’s values to their work every day! 
 If you want your organization to be one in which employees can apply integrity to their work every day, follow the three steps above. Define what living with integrity means for your organization, drill down to the employee level and remove any ambiguity about how employees can live with integrity, and hold everyone in your organization (especially the leadership team) accountable for living with integrity. Once you’ve done this, you will be in a much better position to lead with integrity, maintain your reputation in the marketplace, and navigate complex ethical challenges.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91408634/how-to-integrate-integrity-into-your-company-culture,"lace, new, next, big, thing",2025-09-26T11:52:43.083654+00:00,integrate integrity company

Laid off from tech? Try building an AI-powered business,"The latest wave of tech layoffs doesn’t have to be a step backward—it can be a launchpad. If you’ve spent years shipping products, debugging systems, and partnering with go-to-market teams, you already have what many founders don’t: domain insight and a network. Pair that with  AI  “employees,” (role-specific software agents trained on your company’s data that can perform defined tasks like drafting on-brand content, qualifying leads, and updating CRMs) and your severance becomes seed capital for a lean, scalable company.  
 What’s different now is that the traditional barriers to starting a business have collapsed. The math is transformative: What once required $500,000 in annual salaries can now be achieved for less than $500 a month. Beyond cost, there’s leverage—those complex migrations you managed, the customer insights you unearthed, the systems you architected—that’s IP AI can now operationalize at scale.  
 The most successful builders aren’t just venture-backed startups—they’re experienced operators who realized AI employees can handle everything from customer research to financial analysis, all trained on their specific expertise and methods. Former Google engineers, Meta product managers, and Amazon developers are spinning up businesses with the capacity of a 10-person startup, run solo. Take Todd Krise, who launched  Mercenary Marketing  after two decades in agencies and now teaches others to run lean, AI-powered businesses without traditional overhead. Or Jenna Ahern of  Guardian Owl Digital , who is transforming a decade-old agency into an AI-first  marketing  firm.  
 Tech professionals have a unique edge here: You understand system architecture, data flows, and automation logic, and you know what “good” looks like from UX to code quality—knowledge that becomes exponentially more valuable when deployed through AI agents working 24/7.  
 While I didn’t lose my job, I did choose to leave my job at  TikTok  when changing in‑office requirements and a fading work‑life balance told me it was time to rethink my path. I realized companies were being asked to deliver more with leaner teams, and AI was finally capable of helping. I started Parallel AI soon after with a simple goal to turn anxiety about headcount into AI tools that could help teams automate content, sales workflows, and operations without burning out. 
 Building is messy and setbacks happen, even now. The steps below aim to reduce risk and improve your odds. 
 Start with a real problem 
 
 Write one sentence that states the outcome a buyer wants. 
 Test it with 10 buyer conversations before you build. Ask: What have you tried? What did it cost? What would make this a “yes” in 30 days?   
 A former marketing agency leader, Todd Krise, mapped out how artificial intelligence could replace the bloated, outdated agency model he worked in before launching Mercenary Marketing. He pressure-tested the plan with real clients and deadlines at the start of 2025 to prove that the systems, prices, and deliverables worked before he scaled. 
 If you cannot find 10 people who would pay, change the outcome and try again. 
 
 What to prioritize in the first 30 to 90 days  
 
 Aim to land two or three paid pilots and validate one repeatable way to get customers. 
 Divide your runway into two or three time blocks (for example, 30, 60, and 90 days) with clear milestones. 
 Sell clear outcomes you can deliver in two to six weeks. Use them to confirm the right customers, the right price, and the value you create. 
 Create a simple brand: Think a clear one‑line promise, a basic landing page, and two or three proof pieces (short case example, short demonstration, testimonial). Building trust matters more than polish. 
 Measurement: Pick one main goal (revenue or active pilots) to focus on, and three early signs (qualified talks each week, proposals sent, share of proposals that become sales). 
 Careful spending: Cap monthly spending, and pay yourself a modest paycheck. 
 Platform choice: Prefer a measurable, custom AI agent platform over many single‑purpose tools. Fewer vendors means lower cost, less setup, and a clearer view of what works.  
 
 How to land and execute your first paid pilot 
 Define a tight offer 
 
 Who: one target customer with a clear problem (for example, software companies that sell to businesses but have a weak sales outreach, or agencies that need brand‑safe content in larger amounts). 
 What: a named pilot (for example, “30‑Day Artificial Intelligence Sales Outreach Boost” or “Content in Context Sprint”) with three to five deliverables and success measures. 
 Why now: a clear trigger (new product launch, missed sales target,  hiring  freeze, a backlog of content). 
 
 Use your own relationships to find your first pilot clients 
 
 Use a short, specific outreach
 
 Subject or opener:   “Quick pilot to achieve [outcome] in 30 days” Body (three lines):   We help [customer type] achieve [outcome] without [main headache]. Proposed four‑week pilot:   [deliverables] → success = [measure]. Price: [$X], 50% upfront, applied to ongoing work if it delivers. Worth a 20‑minute fit call next week? If not you, who is best? 
 Include one proof point, a short case example, a short demonstration clip, or a measured personal example. 
 
 
 Reduce friction
 
 Apply the pilot fee to a monthly agreement or offer a partial refund if success measures are not met. 
 Keep paperwork simple with a one‑page work plan with clear data rules and weekly cadence. 
 Make onboarding quick with a startup checklist, access you will need, and a day‑one plan. 
 
 
 Execute to convert
 
 Measure everything! Record starting levels, send weekly updates with a simple measures checklist, and deliver early quick wins.

Why great leaders encourage people to do a career pivot,"Early in my career, a boss encouraged me to leave a stable operations role for a position in sales. They noticed my natural persuasiveness in communication and approach to problems, skills they believed could translate into success in a completely different discipline.  
 It felt like a gamble. I was trading a steady income for compensation directly tied to performance and sales volume. And, I would be venturing into a role where I had no prior experience. But I ultimately took the leap, and that shift changed the entire trajectory of my career.  
 That experience taught me to embrace discomfort and trust in my capacity to grow. It also revealed something fundamental about sales: success doesn’t come from a single mold. Coming from an operations background, I spoke the language of operators, and that authenticity gave me instant credibility with the very people I was selling to. 
 That experience didn’t just redefine my career path; it reshaped how I lead. Today, I actively look for opportunities to help others pivot into roles they never would have considered on their own. With the right encouragement and adequate support, people can thrive in roles in which they have no prior experience.   
 People want growth, but rarely make the first move  
 It’s tempting to keep strong performers exactly where they are. When someone excels in a specific function, moving them can feel like a loss, especially when resources are tight and  hiring  is competitive. But this mindset is shortsighted. Holding people in a specific track because they are performing well may feel efficient in the short term, but it can stagnate both the individual and the organization.   
 One of the most effective ways to help people reach their full potential is to create pathways to grow outside their current functions. This isn’t simply a leadership philosophy; it’s reflective of employee feedback. Overall, 42% of workers are interested in upskilling or looking for upskilling opportunities, according to a  McKinsey report . 
 For most, myself included, pursuing a career pivot is rarely self-induced. People tend to stay where they are comfortable, and taking on a role that requires a new skill set can be daunting and fear-inducing.   
 That’s where leaders come in. Leaders have the power to soften that fear of the unknown. By showing belief in someone’s potential and backing it with support, they’re given the confidence to try something new. And more often than not, people rise to the occasion.  
 When I first joined Fintech, we needed a new  marketing  lead. The natural instinct might have been to hire someone from the outside with a textbook marketing background. But instead, I looked inward.  
 One of our operations team members had been with the company for several years. She had no formal marketing experience, but she understood our customers. She had a creative spark, strong communication skills, and a deep sense of ownership. I encouraged her to consider the role. Today, she’s not only a capable marketing lead, she’s also one of our strongest cross-functional thinkers, bridging the gap between product, ops, and customer success.  
 Making career pivots work  
 These kinds of internal transitions are entirely possible, but they require structure and attentiveness. Individuals with untapped potential who prioritize strong communication, think beyond their interests, go the extra mile, and take pride in their work are prime candidates. They often just need a nudge and someone to believe in their ability to succeed to take the leap.   
 But encouragement alone isn’t enough. Gaining buy-in from the team leader in the department where someone is transitioning is critical. Equally important is crafting a clear, detailed plan and communicating it transparently. Success must be defined in small, achievable milestones.  
 For someone new to sales, that might mean setting a daily target of reaching out to 10 prospects, recording those conversations, and reviewing them with a supervisor to refine their pitch and delivery. In product development, early wins might come from reconnecting with a previous team to discuss a few targeted changes that could have immediate impact.  
 Sometimes, the milestone is simply exposure. Giving someone the opportunity to present to an internal group can be transformative—especially for younger professionals who may have had little experience speaking in front of others. It’s surprising how often that skill is underdeveloped, yet it’s so critical to career progression. 
 Early wins, no matter how minor, build confidence, and confidence is a powerful catalyst for long-term success.   
 Creating a safety net is also essential. Provide reassurance that if the move doesn’t work out, they still have a place within the company. People are far more willing to take risks when they know failure won’t lead to free fall.  
 Our operations lead was hesitant to pivot to marketing at first. Mentorship was central to making this transition successful. It began with short, focused 15-minute daily check-ins—just her and me—where we’d walk through her goals for the day and how she planned to approach them.  
 These conversations created structure, built momentum, and gave her a safe space to ask questions and reflect in real time. The key was setting goals that were both practical and confidence-building.  
 We set early milestones, which included attending management meetings and offering insights from an operations lens that marketing could amplify, collaborating with leadership to understand stakeholder expectations, and delivering a competitive analysis to leadership using her operational expertise to surface gaps and opportunities. 
 As her tactical foundation solidified, our daily meetings transitioned into weekly hourlong strategy sessions. She began to link execution with strategy, and that is where her operational background allowed her to gain trust in other departments. With a clear development plan, dedicated mentorship, and achievable early goals, she settled into the role and began to thrive.   
 The cost of growth vs. the cost of staying still  
 According to the  World Economic Forum , employees will require new skills in the next five years, and six in 10 will require additional training before 2027. Companies that don’t build internal opportunities now risk falling behind, both in talent retention and capability-building.  
 Investing in people this way has always, in my experience, reaped a substantial return on investment. It rarely leads to loss. Both individuals and the company benefit: organizations that prioritize career development  outpace others  on key indicators of business success.   
 A former boss once shared an anecdote that’s stuck with me: A CFO asks the CEO, “What if we invest in training our people and they leave?” The CEO replies, “What if we don’t—and they stay?”  
 Too often, leaders get caught up in costs. What’s far riskier is underinvesting in your team and watching great talent walk out the door, or worse, watching them stay and disengage.   The leaders of tomorrow won’t just be measured by their ability to drive results. They’ll be remembered for their ability to spot potential in unlikely places and to nurture it. Growth isn’t just about upward movement. Sometimes, it’s about having the courage to take on something new and the encouragement to try.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91408472/why-great-leaders-encourage-people-to-do-a-career-pivot,"lace, matte, new, next, thing",2025-09-26T11:52:43.085731+00:00,great leader encourage people career pivot early career boss encourage leave stable operation role position sale notice natural persuasiveness communication approach problem skill believe translate success completely different discipline feel like gamble trade steady income compensation directly tie performance sale volume venture role prior experience ultimately take leap shift change entire trajectory career experience teach embrace discomfort trust capacity grow reveal fundamental sale success come single mold come operation background speak language operator authenticity give instant credibility people sell experience redefine career path reshape lead today actively look opportunity help pivot role consider right encouragement adequate support people thrive role prior experience people want growth rarely tempting strong performer exactly excel specific function move feel like loss especially resource tight hiring competitive mindset shortsighted hold people specific track perform feel efficient short term stagnate individual organization effective way help people reach potential create pathway grow outside current function simply leadership philosophy reflective employee feedback overall worker interested upskille look upskille opportunity accord mckinsey report include pursue career pivot rarely self induce people tend stay comfortable take role require new skill set daunt fear induce leader come leader power soften fear unknown show belief potential back support give confidence try new people rise occasion join fintech need new marketing lead natural instinct hire outside textbook marketing background instead look inward operation team member company year formal marketing experience understand customer creative spark strong communication skill deep sense ownership encourage consider role today capable marketing lead strong cross functional thinker bridge gap product customer success make career pivot work kind internal transition entirely possible require structure attentiveness individual untapped potential prioritize strong communication think interest extra mile pride work prime candidate need nudge believe ability succeed leap encouragement gain buy team leader department transition critical equally important craft clear detailed plan communicate transparently success define small achievable milestone new sale mean set daily target reach prospect record conversation review supervisor refine pitch delivery product development early win come reconnecte previous team discuss target change immediate impact milestone simply exposure give opportunity present internal group transformative especially young professional little experience speak surprising skill underdeveloped critical career progression early win matter minor build confidence confidence powerful catalyst long term success create safety net essential provide reassurance work place company people far willing risk know failure will lead free fall operation lead hesitant pivot marketing mentorship central make transition successful begin short focus minute daily check walk goal day plan approach conversation create structure build momentum give safe space ask question reflect real time key set goal practical confidence building set early milestone include attend management meeting offer insight operation lens marketing amplify collaborate leadership understand stakeholder expectation deliver competitive analysis leadership operational expertise surface gap opportunity tactical foundation solidify daily meeting transition weekly hourlong strategy session begin link execution strategy operational background allow gain trust department clear development plan dedicated mentorship achievable early goal settle role begin thrive cost growth cost stay accord world economic forum employee require new skill year require additional training company build internal opportunity risk fall talent retention capability building invest people way experience reap substantial return investment rarely lead loss individual company benefit organization prioritize career development outpace key indicator business success boss share anecdote stick cfo ask ceo invest train people leave ceo reply stay leader catch cost far risky underinveste team watch great talent walk door bad watch stay disengage leader tomorrow will measure ability drive result remember ability spot potential unlikely place nurture growth upward movement have courage new encouragement try
3 Lessons I learned from regenerative agriculture,"A few years ago, I read an article that changed how I think about bourbon. It wasn’t about distilling or aging. It was about bread. 
 Bread Is Broken  by Ferris Jabr explores how modern industrial farming stripped grains of their flavor and nutritional value in exchange for higher yield, longer shelf life, and cost efficiency. As I read, I kept wondering if flavor has been lost in wheat; what does that mean for the wheat in our whisky? 
 So, I called Dr. David Van Sanford, a wheat breeder at the University of Kentucky, to ask if anyone had studied how farming practices impact flavor. He paused and said, “You’re the first person who’s ever asked me that.” 
 That one question, nearly a decade ago, reenergized our pursuit of flavor. In that time, we expanded our farm operations, benchmarked our sustainability efforts, and doubled down on new regenerative processes: no-till farming, cover cropping, and crop rotation, which we knew would create healthier soil and therefore better flavor in our bourbon, and launched Star Hill Farm Whisky. 
 As we approach Climate Week in New York City, where regenerative agriculture is gaining attention, I want to share three lessons I’ve learned over the past 10 years that continue to guide our work. 
 1. Cultivate an infinite mindset 
 When new leaders join our team, I often hand them a copy of Simon Sinek’s  The Infinite Game . What really struck me about Sinek’s book is the idea that an infinite mindset isn’t about “winning” in the traditional sense; it’s about ensuring the game continues. For me, that means stewardship over short-term gains: How do we leave the land, our bourbon, our culture, and our industry stronger than we found it? 
 That perspective has shaped the way I lead, and it directly connects to regenerative agriculture, which is all about investing in farmland to become more nutrient-dense, flavorful, and resilient for the future. Bourbon is, after all, an agricultural product. If we want bourbon to have a future every bit as rich as its past, we have to be thinking about the long game. Increasingly, distillers are. 
 2. Don’t go at it alone 
 When our team unlocked the deep connection between soil health and flavor, we knew we couldn’t do this alone so we sought out scientists, farmers, researchers, and thinkers like Gabe Brown, whose work on  regenerative systems  helped shape our approach. We quickly found our tribe. 
 We’ve built a lasting partnership with Regenified™ and its CEO, Salar Shemirani, working alongside their team to recognize and certify farmers, ranchers, and communities for their dedication to biodiversity, soil health, water quality, and ecosystem resilience. 
 To amplify their work and the work of Gabe Brown’s Understanding Ag, we launched the Maker’s Mark Regenerative Alliance this year, which provides education and technical support to build healthy farm ecosystems—beginning in the greater Kentucky, New York, and London areas. 
 We’ve already begun onboarding (and continue to invite) farms, bars, and restaurants to adopt regenerative practices in their sourcing, operations, and menu storytelling. You can  nominate a farm or restaurant  that is already practicing regenerative agriculture to join our alliance and help amplify their work. 
 3. Be uncompromising about what matters 
 When my grandparents, Margie and Bill Samuels Sr., founded Maker’s Mark, they chose outlying land in Loretto, Ky, because of its natural water source and proximity to growers. They challenged convention to create a balanced handmade spirit rooted in the land. 
 Now more than ever, people want the products they enjoy and brands they buy to have a higher purpose, be transparent, and authentic to who they are. For us, that translates to an unreasonable commitment to quality made with respect for the land. 
 And it’s encouraging to see distilleries adopting practices that go beyond business as usual, pursuing certifications like B Corp™ and Regenified™ and collaborating through initiatives like the Estate Whiskey Alliance (EWA). 
 As a founding member of the EWA, we’re working alongside whiskey producers, farmers, academic institutions, and suppliers who believe transparency and traceability in ingredient sourcing and production methods are essential for both business and consumers. In just one year, EWA has nearly tripled its membership, certified its first products, and funded groundbreaking research. These are all important steps toward making regenerative farming the expectation rather than the exception. 
 For businesses ready to take similar steps, B Corp™ offers a clear framework and pathway to embed social and environmental responsibility into the heart of operations. Getting involved begins by completing the B Impact Assessment to measure your current impact and chart a course toward certification. Like joining the EWA, it’s an opportunity to be part of a broader movement where collective action accelerates change. 
 These efforts demonstrate that the industry can create a more resilient and sustainable future for bourbon, agriculture, and future generations. 
 So, what does bourbon have to do with the future of farming? More than you might think.

Intel wants a second bite at the Apple—and this time might be better,"Reports Wednesday that Apple has  held talks with Intel  about a possible strategic investment sent shockwaves through the stock market. Intel shares shot up. Apple, the reports said, had begun the talks—initiated by Intel—even before the Trump administration made its controversial announcement that it would buy an $8.9 billion share in the chipmaker.  
 The government’s move had the effect of attracting more investment in Intel, however. U.S.-based Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion and Japan’s Softbank said it would invest $2 billion. 
 Intel is a special case. The storied U.S. chipmaker has fallen on hard times after missing the chance to supply the chips of the mobile revolution. Now it’s far behind in having the technology to design and/or manufacture best-in-class chips that are good at training and running  AI  models.  
 The de facto alternative to a U.S. fabricator of AI chips, meanwhile, is TSMC. At the moment, the AI Revolution depends on advanced chips (most of them Nvidia designs) that are manufactured almost exclusively by TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, a small island 81 miles from mainland China, the U.S.’s fierce rival in AI global dominance.  
 The U.S. is in a big hurry to find ways to de-risk that geopolitical situation. Washington has worked with TSMC to build advanced fabrication facilities on U.S. soil, and the company is now in the process of spending $65 billion on building three giant factories in Arizona.  
 But the chipmaker has found that setting up fabs in the U.S. is far  slower than in Taiwan . That’s thanks to a challenging regulatory and administrative environment, a thorny struggle to acquire permits, and big cost overruns. The company said in January that most of its chip manufacturing would remain in Taiwan, especially for the most advanced chips. 
 It’s one thing to work with TSMC to build fabrication facilities on U.S. soil, but it’s even better to help a U.S. company become a viable second-source option. And Intel, it seems, is America’s best hope for that. But it will require lots of money and expertise.  
 And the company with that expertise is TSMC. In January, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick even approached TSMC to take over Intel’s chip foundry (fabrication) business, which would be divorced from Intel’s chip design business. Those overtures apparently didn’t bear fruit.  
 Apple and Intel have a rocky history 
 With an Apple investment in Intel, it now seems more possible that Apple (and Nvidia) would try to work closely with Intel to bring its fabrication game up to speed. Both of those companies have lots of expertise designing chips, and both have deep relationships with TSMC, which fabricates the designs.  
 Apple has a history with Intel. The company used Intel processors inside its MacBooks from 2006 through 2020, but discontinued the partnership after disappointment with the performance of the processors.  
 Apple also bought Intel modem chips for the iPhone for a time, but again struggled to work with Intel to get the performance it wanted. Apple bought Intel’s modem chip business in 2019, which  gave it a foundation  for designing its own modems. It put the  first custom modem  system-on-a-chip, called C1, into the iPhone 17 this year. 
 Apple and Intel have very different corporate cultures, and have struggled to work well together in the past. During the work on the Intel modem, Intel engineers said that Apple wanted first priority for its projects, demanded to dictate all modem specifications, and insisted on tight timelines with little tolerance for error. Apple found Intel’s culture to be slower and less agile than its own.  
 But a lot has happened at both companies since then. Markets have changed. Intel is far weaker, and Apple is, arguably, somewhat slower in its innovation. And the two companies would be working together for a greater cause than just partnering on phone or laptop components. They’d be central players in helping the U.S. keep pace with China in AI and defusing a potentially dangerous geopolitical situation with regard to TSMC.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91411050/intel-apple-tsmc-chips-trump-iphone,"technology, big, thing, innovation",2025-09-26T11:52:43.087061+00:00,intel want second bite apple time well report wednesday apple hold talk intel possible strategic investment send shockwave stock market intel share shoot apple report say begin talk initiate intel trump administration controversial announcement buy billion share chipmaker government effect attract investment intel nvidia say invest billion japan softbank say invest billion intel special case storied chipmaker fall hard time miss chance supply chip mobile revolution far have technology design manufacture good class chip good training run model facto alternative fabricator chip tsmc moment revolution depend advanced chip nvidia design manufacture exclusively tsmc base taiwan small island mile mainland china fierce rival global dominance big hurry find way risk geopolitical situation washington work tsmc build advanced fabrication facility soil company process spend billion build giant factory arizona chipmaker find set fab far slow taiwan thank challenging regulatory administrative environment thorny struggle acquire permit big cost overrun company say january chip manufacturing remain taiwan especially advanced chip thing work tsmc build fabrication facility soil well help company viable second source option intel america good hope require lot money expertise company expertise tsmc january commerce secretary howard lutnick approach tsmc intel chip foundry fabrication business divorce intel chip design business overture apparently bear fruit apple intel rocky history apple investment intel possible apple nvidia try work closely intel bring fabrication game speed company lot expertise designing chip deep relationship tsmc fabricate design apple history intel company intel processor inside macbooks discontinue partnership disappointment performance processor apple buy intel modem chip iphone time struggle work intel performance want apple buy intel modem chip business give foundation design modem custom modem system chip call iphone year apple intel different corporate culture struggle work past work intel modem intel engineer say apple want priority project demand dictate modem specification insist tight timeline little tolerance error apple find intel culture slow agile lot happen company market change intel far weak apple arguably somewhat slow innovation company work great cause partner phone laptop component central player help pace china defuse potentially dangerous geopolitical situation regard tsmc
Here’s why Trump replaced Biden’s White House portrait with a picture of an autopen,"Along the White House’s West Wing Colonnade, portraits of every U.S. president since George Washington hang side-by-side in gilded frames. Every president, that is, except Joe Biden, whose visage  has been swapped for an image of an autopen . 
 The new portrait display was unveiled on September 24, when the White House  posted images of the updated West Wing to X . The post included a header image zoomed in on Biden’s spot in the lineup, which shows a black-and-white image of an autopen signing the words “Joseph R Biden Jr.” It’s in reference to a controversy, ignited earlier this year by members of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation,  who claimed  that Biden’s team signed several important documents with an autopen due to the former President’s alleged “cognitive decline.” 
 Throughout his second term, President Trump has repeatedly  used art inside the White House to meticulously edit his personal image , trading in convention to airbrush his own legacy in real time. However, this seems to be the first time that the President has moved beyond primping his own portraits to actively disparaging his political adversaries through his home decor.  
 Why has Biden’s portrait been replaced with an autopen? 
 Trump’s choice to replace Biden’s portrait with an image of an autopen is likely a move intended to insult his predecessor on an international stage. 
 The image refers to a controversy that cropped up back in March. At the time, Trump  declared via social media  that some of Biden’s presidential pardons,  including  members of the January 6 Committee, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and members of Biden’s family beyond his son Hunter, were void because they were signed by an autopen device.  
 The accusation came despite the fact that autopens, which are robotic devices used to duplicate signatures,  have been used in the White House since Harry Truman . Trump himself likely used an autopen during his first term. A Republican committee, led by U.S. Representative James Comer, is  currently investigating  the idea that the autopen was used as a “cover-up” for Biden’s cognitive decline. 
 Regardless of what the committee may find, the concept of a current President using the very walls of the White House as a canvas to target a former President is essentially unheard of. For Trump, though, it’s reflective of a broader pattern.  
 Why this represents a concerning escalation 
 Immediately after taking office in January, Trump foreshadowed how he planned to rebrand his image during his second term through the reveal of his official portrait. Trump chose to scrap all previous conventions around presidential portraiture—like genial expressions and down-to-earth posing—instead choosing  to model his headshot after his mugshot . Since then, the President has embarked on a monthslong campaign to adopt a sterner, darker personal brand that aligns with his desired image of control. 
 In February, reporters  spotted a framed image of a  New York Post  magazine spotlighting Trump’s mugshot  posted just outside the Oval Office. That same month, his administration took down a minimalist portrait of former president Barack Obama in the East Room  for a pop-art painting of President Trump raising his fist  after  the assassination attempt  last year on the campaign trail. In April,  a portrait of Trump’s face featuring a superimposed American flag  appeared between a portrait of Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan. In May,  a painting of Trump edited together with Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan  showed up in the West Wing.  
 And in August, deputy assistant to the President  Sebastian Gorka took to X  to share another new painting of Trump walking through a line of American flags with his coat billowing behind him, alongside the caption: “One of the new @WhiteHouse paintings of President @realDonaldTrump. More to come.” 
 Outside of art, Trump is also making several more permanent changes to the White House itself. Currently, the President is in the process of redesigning the White House’s Rose Garden  in the image of his Mar-a-Lago resort  and imposing his opulent, Rococo-inspired design aesthetic on  a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom . In a move that almost feels closer to parody than reality, the Trump administration  also recently announced plans  to convert the White House’s South Lawn into a UFC arena for a 2026 match. 
 All of these aesthetic decisions point back to Trump’s general attitude around the White House: that it is less a historical site, and more a stage for his own personal ends—whether that means  molding the building to his narrow view of “good” architecture , or using its decor to squeeze in a last jab at Biden.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91410821/why-trump-replaced-biden-portrait-autopen,"lace, new, announced",2025-09-26T11:52:43.087738+00:00,trump replace biden white house portrait picture autopen white house west wing colonnade portrait president george washington hang gild frame president joe biden visage swap image autopen new portrait display unveil september white house post image update west wing post include header image zoom biden spot lineup show black white image autopen sign word joseph biden reference controversy ignite early year member conservative think tank heritage foundation claim biden team sign important document autopen president allege cognitive decline second term president trump repeatedly art inside white house meticulously edit personal image trading convention airbrush legacy real time time president move primp portrait actively disparage political adversary home decor biden portrait replace autopen trump choice replace biden portrait image autopen likely intend insult predecessor international stage image refer controversy crop march time trump declare social medium biden presidential pardon include member january committee anthony fauci member biden family son hunter void sign autopen device accusation come despite fact autopen robotic device duplicate signature white house harry truman trump likely autopen term republican committee lead representative james comer currently investigate idea autopen cover biden cognitive decline regardless committee find concept current president wall white house canvas target president essentially unheard trump reflective broad pattern represent concern escalation immediately take office january trump foreshadow plan rebrand image second term reveal official portrait trump choose scrap previous convention presidential portraiture like genial expression earth posing instead choose model headshot mugshot president embark monthslong campaign adopt sterner dark personal brand align desire image control february reporter spot frame image new york post magazine spotlight trump mugshot post outside oval office month administration take minimalist portrait president barack obama east room pop art painting president trump raise fist assassination attempt year campaign trail april portrait trump face feature superimposed american flag appear portrait hillary clinton nancy reagan painting trump edit abraham lincoln ronald reagan show west wing august deputy assistant president sebastian gorka take share new painting trump walk line american flag coat billow alongside caption new painting president come outside art trump make permanent change white house currently president process redesign white house rose garden image mar lago resort impose opulent rococo inspire design aesthetic new square foot ballroom feel close parody reality trump administration recently announce plan convert white house south lawn ufc arena match aesthetic decision point trump general attitude white house historical site stage personal end mean mold building narrow view good architecture decor squeeze jab biden
Ryder Cup 2025: How to watch golf’s ultimate team showdown as it comes to New York,"Most people do not put New York City and golf together, nor do they consider the game to be a team sport.  
 The 2025 Ryder Cup is challenging these views. The competition will be held just outside of the Big Apple at Bethpage State Park’s Black Course in Farmingdale, New York. 
 From Friday, September 26, through Sunday, September 28, 12 Americans and 12 Europeans will go head-to-head. Let’s take a look at the history and format before covering how to tune in for every stroke and birdie. 
 The history of the Ryder Cup 
 The Ryder Cup is  named after  its patron, Sam Ryder, a British businessman and golf enthusiast. He fell in love with the sport after taking it up to help him recover from an illness and wanted to help the game gain international acclaim. The first official event took place in 1927 at the Worcester Country Club in Massachusetts. 
 Originally, the competition was just between American and British men, with the United States taking home the first trophy. U.S. captain Walter Hagen led the Americans to victory over the team from Great Britain supervised by Ted Ray. 
 The Americans dominated the early years of the competition, so in 1979, Great Britain’s team began allowing other Europeans to participate in order to even the playing field. The U.S. still has the upper hand, though, with 27 wins to Europe’s 15. 
 The format of the Ryder Cup 
 The competition takes place every two years. The teams play 28 matches total, with each match being worth one point. The first team to 14.5 wins. In the event of a tie, the defending champion keeps the cup. 
 The first two days involve team-based play in foursomes and four-balls formats. In foursomes play, two players from each team join forces and share a ball, alternating shots. The lowest score wins the hole. 
 Four-balls play is similar, but each team member uses his own ball and the lowest of the two scores counts for the team. The team with the lowest score wins the hole. 
 The third day of competition is much simpler. There are singles matches with players facing off one-on-one.

 There are two ways to make the American or European team. The first six players automatically qualify based on past performance and rankings. The next six are picked by the team captains. 
 Keegan Bradley, while  not playing  himself, will oversee the Americans. He named Sam Burns, Patrick Cantlay, Ben Griffin, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, and Cameron Young. They will join Scottie Scheffler, J.J. Spaun, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English, and Bryson DeChambeau. 
 This year, the Americans have an  extra incentive  to participate. They will be awarded $500,000 each for their efforts, with $300,000 going toward charity and the players walking away with a $200,000 stipend. The Europeans do not have this payday and are in it just for the bragging rights. 
 Luke Donald is the team captain on the European side. Rory McIlroy, Robert MacIntyre, Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose, Rasmus Højgaard, and Tyrrell Hatton automatically qualified. They will be joined by Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm, Sepp Straka, and Ludvig Åberg, who were appointed by Donald. 
 How to watch the 2025 Ryder Cup 
 There are many ways to catch all the action of the 45th Ryder Cup. For the visually minded, the drama will be spread out on multiple television networks. 
 The opening ceremonies will be broadcast on the Golf Channel on Thursday, September 25, from 4 to 7 p.m. ET. 
 The following day, the USA Network gets the honors, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. NBC will televise the final two days of competition. 
 On Saturday, the action takes place from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET. On Sunday, you can sleep in, because the coverage goes from noon to 6 p.m. ET. 
 Those who prefer radio can tune in to Ryder Cup Radio on SiriusXM during the same broadcast hours as the televised versions. 
 Cord-cutters can see some selective matches on  RyderCup.com , the Ryder Cup app, and NBCUniversal’s  Peacock  streaming service. 
 If you simply cannot get enough of the coverage, Peacock will air a morning pre-show hosted by  SNL ’s Colin Jost.",https://www.fastcompany.com/91409084/ryder-cup-2025-live-stream-watch-golf-ultimate-team-showdown,"lace, new, next, big",2025-09-26T11:52:43.088346+00:00,ryder cup watch golf ultimate team showdown come new york people new york city golf consider game team sport ryder cup challenge view competition hold outside big apple bethpage state park black course farmingdale new york friday september sunday september americans europeans head head let look history format cover tune stroke birdie history ryder cup ryder cup name patron sam ryder british businessman golf enthusiast fall love sport take help recover illness want help game gain international acclaim official event take place worcester country club massachusetts originally competition american british man united states take home trophy captain walter hagen lead americans victory team great britain supervise ted ray americans dominate early year competition great britain team begin allow europeans participate order playing field upper hand win europe format ryder cup competition take place year team play match total match worth point team win event tie defend champion keep cup day involve team base play foursome ball format foursome play player team join force share ball alternate shot low score win hole ball play similar team member use ball low score count team team low score win hole day competition simple single match player face play ryder cup way american european team player automatically qualify base past performance ranking pick team captain keegan bradley play oversee americans name sam burns patrick cantlay ben griffin collin morikawa justin thomas cameron young join scottie scheffler spaun xander schauffele russell henley harris english bryson dechambeau year americans extra incentive participate award effort charity player walk away stipend europeans payday bragging right luke donald team captain european rory mcilroy robert macintyre tommy fleetwood justin rose rasmus højgaard tyrrell hatton automatically qualify join shane lowry viktor hovland matt fitzpatrick jon rahm sepp straka ludvig åberg appoint donald watch ryder cup way catch action ryder cup visually minded drama spread multiple television network open ceremony broadcast golf channel thursday september following day usa network get honor nbc televise final day competition saturday action take place sunday sleep coverage noon prefer radio tune ryder cup radio siriusxm broadcast hour televise version cord cutter selective match ryder cup app nbcuniversal peacock stream service simply coverage peacock air morning pre host snl colin jost
Amazon might owe you money: $1.5 billion payout for Prime members follows FTC settlement. Here’s what to know,"Amazon  reached a $2.5 billion settlement  with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Thursday over whether the e-commerce giant used “deceptive methods” to sign up consumers for Prime subscriptions, then made it “exceedingly difficult” to cancel. 
 The agency argued Amazon enrolled millions of customers in Prime subscriptions without their consent, and knowingly made it difficult for consumers to get out of the agreement. 
 That settlement, which comes just three days into the civil trial in federal court in Seattle, included a whopping $1 billion civil penalty, the highest in history, and a $1.5 billion fund to refund  Prime users  harmed by the deceptive enrollment practices.   The e-commerce giant must also create an easier way for users to cancel, which includes modifying its interface, and “cease unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.” 
 “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said  in a statement .  
 The FTC case  charged Amazon  and several company executives with knowingly misleading millions of consumers into enrolling in Prime, violating the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA). Documents in the lead-up to trial were cited to show Amazon executives and employees “knowingly discussed these unlawful enrollment and cancellation issues”—making comments such as, “subscription driving is a bit of a shady world,” and stating that leading consumers to unwanted subscriptions is “an unspoken cancer.” 
 Amazon did not admit to or deny the FTC’s allegations about misleading customers in the settlement, and told  Fast Company  in a statement: “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.” Amazon also said it will “move forward and focus on innovating for customers” following the settlement. 
 Industry experts react 
 Reactions to the settlement have been mixed. 
 “After defrauding tens of millions of people with an intentionally labyrinthine cancellation process, the FTC is allowing Amazon and its executives to walk away scot-free,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit that advocates for corporate accountability legislation. “That double standard is why so many Americans have lost faith in this administration’s willingness to hold corporate lawbreakers accountable.” 
 Others said the settlement may have made Prime easier to cancel, but the program will continue to remain in many American households.  
 “The settlement with the FTC may streamline Prime’s cancellation process, but it won’t dent the program’s dominance,” Emarketer analyst Zak Stambor told  Fast Company . “Prime brought in $44 billion in subscription revenue last year alone—so the payout represents just 5.6% of that total. With more than 200 million global members, including three-quarters of U.S. households, Prime is the backbone of Amazon’s business model.” 
 Meanwhile, some consumer watchdog groups were pleased by the settlement, and called on the FTC to resurrect “ click-to-cancel ” rules to make it easier to cancel auto-renewing agreements such as streaming subscriptions and gym memberships. 
 “This is a great day for consumers—not just Amazon customers, but everyone who gets roped into any kind of subscription or agreement in questionable ways,” said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund. “In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.”",https://www.fastcompany.com/91411023/amazon-prime-subscribers-will-get-15-billion-money-back-in-ftc-cancel-membership-lawsuit-settlement,"new, consumer",2025-09-26T11:52:43.088860+00:00,amazon owe money billion payout prime member follow ftc settlement know amazon reach billion settlement federal trade commission ftc thursday commerce giant deceptive method sign consumer prime subscription exceedingly difficult cancel agency argue amazon enrol million customer prime subscription consent knowingly difficult consumer agreement settlement come day civil trial federal court seattle include whopping billion civil penalty high history billion fund refund prime user harm deceptive enrollment practice commerce giant create easy way user cancel include modify interface cease unlawful enrollment cancellation practice today put billion dollar americans pocket make sure amazon ftc chairman andrew ferguson say statement ftc case charge amazon company executive knowingly misleading million consumer enrolling prime violate ftc act restore online shoppers confidence act rosca document lead trial cite amazon executive employee knowingly discuss unlawful enrollment cancellation comment subscription driving bit shady world state lead consumer unwanted subscription unspoken cancer amazon admit deny ftc allegation mislead customer settlement tell fast company statement work incredibly hard clear simple customer sign cancel prime membership offer substantial value million loyal prime member world amazon say forward focus innovate customer follow settlement industry expert react reaction settlement mix defraud ten million people intentionally labyrinthine cancellation process ftc allow amazon executive walk away scot free say nidhi hegde executive director american economic liberties project nonprofit advocate corporate accountability legislation double standard americans lose faith administration willingness hold corporate lawbreaker accountable say settlement prime easy cancel program continue remain american household settlement ftc streamline prime cancellation process will dent program dominance emarketer analyst zak stambor tell fast company prime bring billion subscription revenue year payout represent total million global member include quarter household prime backbone amazon business model consumer watchdog group please settlement call ftc resurrect click cancel rule easy cancel auto renew agreement streaming subscription gym membership great day consumer amazon customer get rope kind subscription agreement questionable way say teresa murray consumer watchdog director pirg education fund meantime hope amazon settlement send strong message company operate way conceivably confuse customer thwart effort customer
